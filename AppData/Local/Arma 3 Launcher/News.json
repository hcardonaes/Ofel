Together with Bohemia Interactive, we are proud to present the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/jets\">Arma 3 Jets DLC<\/a>. In this OPREP, we'll briefly delve into the DLC's content and its development.<\/p> <h3>BRAVO ZERO ONE<\/h3> <p>First I would still like to introduce BRAVO ZERO ONE Studios (or B01 for short). We are a team of professional creative developers from all over the world whom are responsible for the design and creation of Arma 3 Jets. You could say we're the 'architects', but Bohemia Interactive has helped us immensely in terms of providing support and mastering the content. Additionally, various members on the Arma 3 development team were responsible for developing the new platform updates and features coming with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/jets\">Jets DLC<\/a>. Of course, throughout the entire process, we've been advising each other to ensure a splendid and consistent package. <\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <img src=\"\/assets\/img\/logos\/B01_Logo.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail\" style=\"width: 300px\"> <\/p> <p> All in all, it's truly been an adventure, so let me introduce our team here at B01. As stated before, we're an international team of developers coming from both North and South America and Europe. We have a few notable team members, many of which are industry professionals with ties to the Arma modding community. These are: <em>Christopher Peral<\/em>, <em>Don Ray Reed<\/em>, <em>Luiz Cordova<\/em>, <em>Dennis Kahl<\/em>, <em>Lingfeng Hou<\/em>, <em>Don Welch<\/em>, <em> Rob Graham<\/em>, <em>John K. Noviks<\/em>, and of course, myself. Without these people, this project would never have made it off the ground (pun intended!). <\/p> <h3>THREE JETS AND A DRONE<\/h3><p> <div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/arma3_jetsdlc_screenshot_01.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/arma3_jetsdlc_screenshot_01.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/arma3_jetsdlc_screenshot_03.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/arma3_jetsdlc_screenshot_03.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/arma3_jetsdlc_screenshot_05.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/arma3_jetsdlc_screenshot_05.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/arma3_jetsdlc_screenshot_07.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/arma3_jetsdlc_screenshot_07.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <\/div> <\/p><p>After much discussion, concepting, prototyping, and eventually production, the aircraft have finally arrived on Arma 3's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a>.

Therefore, we got in touch with Team Mike Producer <em> Lukáš Miláček<\/em>, and sat down to brainstorm about various gameplay approache s. The intention was to deliver more engaging, balanced, and authentic gameplay for Arma pilots, and ultimately, a more fun experience. <\/p> <p>One part of this meant having new high-fidelity art models, but also new gameplay features. While there was a significant wishlist, we ultimately prioritized the Sensor Overhaul, Dynamic Vehicle Loadouts, upgraded Damage Model, and HUD improvements. Some of these new features we plan to explain in more detail in another OPREP, but we can definitely say they help a lot to make the new airframes stand out. <\/p> <p>Overall, during the last year and a half of development, we have built a close and strong partnership between Bohemia Interactive and our studio. We managed to successfully overcome various challenges, ranging from communicating via the Internet while everyone is in a different time zone, to making large scale design decisions. It’s been a experience with many late night\/early morning meetings on Skype, many finished notepads, and sticky notes everywhere. Thousands of hours went into the creation of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/jets\">Jets DLC<\/a>. <\/p> <h3>DESIGNING A JET<\/h3> <p> Just to give you some insight into what it takes to produce a new Arma 3 jet, let's briefly go through the process. Designing an authentic and believable fighter aircraft, with all its controls and functionality, is a daunting and thrilling task . There is so much to be considered, from aerodynamics and physics, to placement of the ' NO STEP' stamp on the right parts of the wings. We knew from the onset that we wanted to tackle naval aviation, and what better aircraft platform to work from than the Boeing F\/A-18E Super Hornet? It is one of my personal favorite aircraft and a staple of naval aviation.<\/p><p> <div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/jets_oprep_fa181_base_002.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/jets_oprep_fa181_base_002.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/jets_oprep_fa181_high_003.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/jets_oprep_fa181_high_003.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/jets_oprep_fa181_finial_001.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/jets_oprep_fa181_finial_001.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <\/div> <\/p><p>However, we also needed an aircraft that would fit with the US NATO forces that are currently present in vanilla Arma 3. Something a little futuristic, and plausible in the 'Armaverse'. So we began by playing with the idea of “futurizing” the F\/A-18E, and combining the airframe with elements of fifth generation aircraft, notably the Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor and F-35C Lightning II. It was interesting to take elements of three completely different aircraft and combine them into a single coherent airframe, but: challenge accepted. We began with some basic 2D concepting, but then quickly realized that 2D art would not help us with such a complex series of shapes, so we began to concept in 3D instead. This allowed for greater room to adjust the concept, as we could now visually see the full size and shape of the airframe in real time and adjust, delete, create as needed.<\/p><p> <div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/jets_oprep_screenshot032.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/jets_oprep_screenshot032.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/jets_oprep_screenshot017.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/jets_oprep_screenshot017.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/jets_oprep_screenshot062.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/jets_oprep_screenshot062.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <\/div> <\/p><p>Once the 3D concept was completed and approved by both B01 and Bohemia Interactive, we moved on to a full prototype model. This, like most game art, went through multiple iterations before the final prototype was created and approved. Many challenges had to be overcome, such as how would we do the wing-tip folding, the placement and deployment of the rear landing gear, and the shape and design of the cockpit, just to name a few. At the end we had a cohesive and futuristic F\/A-18 that we found to be authentic and believable. We dubbed her the Black Wasp II.<\/p> <p>From concept to finish, the F\/A-181 Black Wasp II has been one of our favorite projects to work on. We look forward to the community reactions of seeing this beauty in the skies of Arma 3 and we greatly appreciate the community feedback.<\/p> <h3>TEST FLIGHT (DEV-BRANCH)<\/h3> <p>All in all, I hope that everything above brings some insight in the development of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/jets\">Jets DLC<\/a>, and the collaboration between B01 and Bohemia Interactive. We are confident that the new aircraft and features will enhance aerial combat in the future to come for the Arma community. <\/p> <p>For now, we have just deployed the new jets to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a>, so be sure to take them for a spin. We will be paying attention to your valuable feedback on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/forums\/forum\/218-arma-3\/\">forums<\/a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/feedback.bistudio.com\/project\/view\/1\/\">Feedback Tracker<\/a>. After release, we plan to keep working and improving this set of assets, including things like flight behavior and onboard weapons systems. Plus there might be one or two small surprises down the runway. <\/p> <p>To close off, we look forward to all of the videos, screenshots, and of course feedback, ideas and suggestions. The community is why we do game development, and the community is the definitive proof of Arma’s success. <\/p> <p>Thank you for your support!<\/p> <p>Joshua “Saul” Carpenter<br>BRAVO ZERO ONE Studios <\/p>","created_at":"2017-04-12 11:24:26","excerpt":"<p>\u000aPartnering up to bring you the best DLC jet!\u000a<\/p>","id":331,"post_header_image":null,"post_thumb":null,"public_date":"2017-04-15 11:16:00","published":"1","title":"OPREP - JETS DLC","type":"oprep","updated_at":"2017-04-18 09:26:09","url":"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-jets-dlc"},{"animation_interval":200,"author":"Vojtěch Kovařič","content":"<p>FROM: High Command<br> TO: Arma 3 Users<br> UNIT: Main Branch<br> ACTIVITY: Hotfix 1.68 (Campaign Progress, Start-up Crash)<br> SIZE: ~57 MB \/ ~18 MB (depends on Apex ownership)<\/p> <h1>NOTES<\/h1> <ul> <li>Consider using the Steam client option to verify the integrity of the local game cache to avoid corrupted data after downloading this update. <\/li> <li>Consider defragmenting your HDD after downloading large updates.<\/li> <li>Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks.

Check <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/arma\/comments\/5ztlr9\/fast_64bit_server_faq\/\" target=\"_blank\">this reddit post<\/a> for more details. Players can also experience issues with their <b>graphics drivers<\/b> not switching correctly between GPUs (on-board vs dedicated), resulting in degraded performance of the game. We are in talk with <b>third-party driver developers<\/b> to resolve this issue as soon as possible.

Our primary target was a release of the <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/apex\">Apex expansion<\/a> (<em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/RoadToApex?src=hash\">#RoadToApex<\/a><\/em>), and we decided to separate the platform improvements into several smaller chunks, which were easier to test and gave us a solid foundation for the release itself:<\/p> <ul> <li>The first update of 2016 was <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00052\">1.56<\/a><\/strong>, which brought the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Eden_Editor\">Eden Editor<\/a><\/strong>. Building scenarios in a native <strong>3D in-game tool<\/strong> was one of the most requested features on the <a href=\"https:\/\/feedback.bistudio.com\/\">Feedback Tracker<\/a>. We were happy to see all the highly <strong>detailed compositions<\/strong> appearing on <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/workshop\/browse\/?appid=107410\">Steam Workshop<\/a> just days after <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Eden_Editor\">Eden Editor<\/a> hit the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a>. An Audio Engine Overhaul brought significant improvements to audio simulation; something even our future games will benefit from. <\/li> <li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00054\">Update 1.58<\/a><\/strong> introduced the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Tasks_Overhaul\">Tasks Overhaul<\/a><\/strong> as its main feature. Visualization of the in-game tasks brought several benefits and certainly helped to improve even our existing content, not to mention content made by the community. Weapon switching on the move also came alive with this update, making movement across the battlefield and in stressful situations more fluid and intuitive. <\/li> <li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00056\">Update 1.60<\/a><\/strong> delivered the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-visual-upgrade\">Visual Upgrade<\/a><\/strong>: significant visual improvements to all <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/\">Arma 3<\/a> terrains. Aside from that, several important gameplay mechanics were introduced: <strong>Quick Play<\/strong>, <strong>Line Drawing<\/strong>, and <strong>Limping<\/strong>. <\/li> <li>The<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/apex\">Apex expansion<\/a><\/strong> came with a great amount of new assets, units, scenarios and vehicles. With its crown jewel <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/tanoa\">Tanoa<\/a><\/strong> shining brightly, it soon became one of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/best-expansions-in-pc-gaming\/\">top-rated expansions<\/a> in the PC gaming industry. And again there were platform improvements for everybody in the associated <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00058\">Update 1.62<\/a><\/strong>: the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Main_Menu\">Main Menu<\/a><\/strong> and the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Revive\">Revive<\/a><\/strong> feature were completely overhauled, we introduced some key game mechanics (e.g. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Vehicle_in_Vehicle_Transport\">Vehicle in Vehicle Transport<\/a><\/strong>), and iterated in many more areas. <\/li> <li>With <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00059\">Update 1.64<\/a><\/strong>, we turned our attention to addressing some low-level issues and aimed to <strong>improve the performance of objects<\/strong> and <strong>behavior of the AI<\/strong>. <strong>Simple Objects<\/strong> integration helped with reducing the performance demands. As a result, bigger and more complex compositions now require less computing power and make the game run faster. AI drivers of wheeled vehicles should also behave much more reliably due to the<a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/ai-path-following-improvements\"><strong> changes to their path-following<\/strong><\/a>. <\/li> <li>The latest addition, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00062\">Update 1.66<\/a><\/strong>, was a result of long period of bug fixing. While there still are remaining issues, the development team managed to address a large number of long-standing issues and made the platform more solid for what's to come in the future. <\/li> <\/ul> <p>And what does the future bring us all? We're not keeping it a secret, the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/arma-3-roadmap-2016-17#.WEaGHfkrJaQ\">plans for 2017<\/a><\/strong> have been public for some time now.

In this OPREP, we'd like to highlight some of Combat Patrol's qualities in detail - and, most importantly, invite you to play it, provide feedback, and\/or even modify the original concept to your liking. <\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_combat_patrol_1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"Combat Patrol features many unique squad roles, and they even come with a dedicated insignia patch!\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_combat_patrol_1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <h3>WHY WE FIGHT<\/h3> <p>Combat Patrol offers quick cooperative gameplay by placing you and your squad mates together into an infantry team, and giving you the option to select the area that you want to play in. Each session is different thanks to the scenario's heavily randomized nature. That said, compared to some of the more broad and complex community frameworks for randomized scenarios, Combat Patrol is much more straightforward. Instead, it offers a quick and simple gateway to a more hardcore Arma experience.<\/p> <p>In fact, the intention behind the very first prototype of Combat Patrol, which we called \"MOUT Training\" (\"Military Operations in Urban Terrain\") back then, was to offer <strong>instant<\/strong> challenging combat with a little team of friends against Arma's AI, without making things too complex. This prototype scenario helped us internally to introduce some of our new colleagues to 'classic' military sandbox gameplay - and the randomized nature of the scenario ensured replayability. <\/p> <p>The first location we used was the Altian town of Athira, and the goal was to pass through a chain of five randomly selected objectives, which the players had to find using only their map and compass. In the process, players also had to battle a few randomized infantry groups. However, we eventually became bored of playing in a single location. Thus, we came up with the idea of generating the scenario in every village based on a map's key points. <\/p> <h3>DYNAMIC BATTLEFIELD<\/h3> <p>Once Josef Zemánek managed to bring the same gameplay to every village on every official map available in Arma 3, we spent significant time just 'browsing' the locations in various daytime and weather conditions. With all those different locations, the replayability skyrocketed as well, leading to some of our most intense or funny gameplay moments, many of which we remember to this day.<\/p> <p>Admittedly, the scenario was still rather crude, and especially the way that objectives were presented was considered too abstract by most of the players. However, thanks to the joint effort of our Sandbox Designers (Miloslav Cinko, Radko Voda), QA (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/razazel314\">Radek Pazdera<\/a>), Josef Zemánek as the Technical Designer, and the plentiful and passionate internal feedback we received, we've now reached a version polished enough for a public test.<\/p> <p>In the latest iteration, which takes place on Altis, you can vote for the scenario's location, the amount of OPFOR scales according to number of players, there are custom-created roles designed for the PvE experience, we came up with a plausible scenario objective, and you can tweak the difficulty by changing the mission parameters.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_combat_patrol_2.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"There are more than 40 towns and villages on Altis where you can play Combat Patrol.\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_combat_patrol_2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <h3>DIFFICULTY RECOMMENDED!<\/h3> <p>While many of us here are no die-hard milsim players, we appreciate a challenge that comes not only from the firefights, but also team coordination and tactics. From the very start, we attempted to design Combat Patrol in a way which would allow us to play on a high difficulty, but the challenge would still remain acceptable - even for the less experienced player among us. Even so, we actually ended up playing with most of the GUI elements turned off or toned down, and on a pretty high difficulty.<\/p> <p>On many occasions, we failed miserably, and we still do sometimes. But we found that, what might sound as Combat Patrol's shortcoming, is in fact its most interesting feature. Once we learned to cope with the challenge, we realized that defeat was always due to our own mistakes: botched reconnaissance, failed execution of the plan, or a complete disarray in team communication and role play. The good news is that after several of those games, people tend to improve in many ways. The team becomes coherent, people truly cooperate and communicate, tactics and interesting solutions emerge. The occasional moments of gallantry suddenly stop leading to casualties.<\/p> <p>In order to make the most of playing the scenario, don't be ashamed to play slowly, scout your surroundings, plan your movement and retreat if you get under too much pressure. The key is to keep moving, remain one step ahead of the enemy by flanking and deceiving them, and avoid alarming the enemy garrison too early as there are enemy reinforcements waiting for the signal. As can be said about Arma 3 itself, Combat Patrol rewards patience, thoroughness, and cooperation.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_combat_patrol_3.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"Map, navigation aids, and drawing are no gimmicks in Combat Patrol!

Our ambition is mostly to nail down the balance and difficulty of the experience, and to further enrich the content. We are discussing new objectives, musing about adding some non-urbanized locations, as well as taking the gameplay to other Bohemia terrains - of course, with different factions to play for and against. There's a pool of brainstormed objectives which await implementation and testing.<\/p> <p>Besides our own efforts, we aim to offer the scenario's code to the Arma 3's creative community for free use. An example of the usage of the modules is currently available in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/390500\/\">Arma 3 Samples<\/a>, and we hope to make full sources available under the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bistudio.com\/community\/licenses\/arma-public-license-share-alike\">Arma Public License - Share Alike (APL-SA)<\/a> in future. Naturally, we are also interested in your experience with the scenario. Although we've had dozens play-tests in various stages of development, its random nature may often lead to very unexpected results or reveal shortcomings that we haven't yet come across. I'm sure there will be plenty of ideas and bug reports, and you are welcome to post them to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/200433-combat-patrol\/\">official forums<\/a> and\/or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/feedback.arma3.com\/\">Feedback Tracker<\/a>.<\/p> <p>You'll find the scenario once you switch to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Development Branch<\/a>.

Many of our own community have hoped or suspected that, sooner or later, this simply had to happen to our beloved series as well. To bring an end to the eternal discussion about whether it is (im)possible to bring 64-bit support to Arma - and to live up to your hopes - <strong>we are proud to announce that 64-bit Arma 3 is knocking right at your door, now released on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a><\/strong>. But what exactly are the benefits of having a 64-bit game, what does it mean for you as gamers, and why did you have to wait until now? <\/p> <h3>A BIT OF A WAIT<\/h3> <p>Somewhere on the forums one of our loyal community members wrote \"there is no simple 'click a button' and it magically becomes 64-bit.\" That is very true. We currently employ no mages, so we had to improvise and hit those buttons a few (tens of thousands) times. Porting a project which had not been designed with 64-bit in mind is no easy task; with a code base as huge as Arma's, it is doubly true. Other than Arma itself, we had to update our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Launcher\">Launcher <\/a>, too (thanks to that, you will now be able to choose your version of the game splendidly).<\/p> <p>One of the main reasons for the delay is that the time simply had to be right for us. 64-bit executables need a 64-bit OS and 64-bit CPU to run. If there are not enough users with such systems, there would be only little reason for us to invest time and experts into working on something this big. Fortunately, the last few generations of processors have been 64-bit. Therefore, it comes down to your OS. According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/hwsurvey?platform=combined\">Steam statistics<\/a>, over 90% of player machines now have a 64-bit OS installed.<\/p> <p>Naturally, it is not all only about programming. In order to make this effort a reality, different departments had to do their part as well. More than anything else, testing has been a huge part of the porting process, taking a lot of time. It is no wonder. <strong>There were hundreds of obstacles we had to overcome, some smaller, other greater, and our QA colleagues needed to verify that everything still worked as expected after all these changes<\/strong>. In the end, we feel we succeeded to tame the beast - and we hope you will be just as excited about the results.<\/p> <h3>A BIT OF BACKGROUND<\/h3> <p>In order to understand what this magical number means, we need to get technical. We will keep it as concise as possible (of course, at the expense of accuracy, for which we kindly hope anyone technically gifted will excuse us). When processing tasks, your CPU works with data stored somewhere in memory. This memory can be local to the CPU (registers, cache) or external (system memory aka RAM). What interests us the most right now are registers and system memory.<\/p> <p>In general, registers are very small and very fast data containers. They come in various forms and sizes ranging from 8 to 64-bits. The amount of bits determines the largest number a CPU can process without any extra work. 32-bit processors can work with numbers as large as 2^32-1=4,294,967,295 (-1 because we start from zero). 64-bit processors take it a<em> few billion<\/em> steps further and stop at an amazing 2^64-1=18,446,744,073,709,551,615. <strong>This comes quite handy when performing complex calculations and addressing memory.<\/strong><\/p> <p>Speaking of memory, let us translate these huge numbers to something more understandable. In the vocabulary of computer memory, 2^32 can be translated to 4 gigabytes while 2^64 equals to 65 <em>peta<\/em>bytes. In simplistic terms, a 32-bit system can physically address at most 4 GB of memory. On top of that, the address space of a 32-bit application running on such a system is usually split in two parts. On Windows, each of them is 2 GB. One is reserved for your applications, the other one for Windows itself. <\/p> <h3>A BIT MORE MEMORY<\/h3> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_64bit_exec_2.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"Dynamically streamed terrain and large view-distances are some of Arma's strengths, but more memory should help makes things smoother\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_64bit_exec_2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>Now imagine you have to squeeze Arma - with all of its large terrains and many things going on during a mission - into this relatively small space. As time passed, and as Arma grew larger, this has proven to be a more and more difficult task. Being able to utilize virtually all of your system's memory, more than anything, Arma should show a lot more <em>consistent<\/em> performance.<\/p> <p>With the ability to cache a huge amount of data in-game, less loading\/releasing of memory is necessary. This translates into less work for the game to do and, ultimately, into more fluent gameplay. One case where an update in performance should be more recognizable is when playing the game with very large view distances. Given that the amount of data to cache is rather large in such cases, the game will greatly benefit from an increased amount of available RAM (but, note, it may be bottlenecked by other factors).<\/p> <p><strong>An important side effect of having larger address space is that we expect fewer memory-related crashes to happen<\/strong>. With no free memory, sooner or later the game (or any other application for that matter) is bound to reach a state where it simply has no other choice but to cause us all sorrow. Memory limits are set in stone; whether a crash is caused by a GPU driver or Arma itself does not really matter from a player's point of view. Trust us, there is nothing more painful then seeing you sad because the game crashed. In 64-bit Arma, this should be less likely.<\/p> <h3>A BIT OF CAUTION<\/h3> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_64bit_exec_1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"After a long scenario with huge view distances, we can see (64-bit) Arma 3 using ~8GB of memory\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_64bit_exec_1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>Do not expect a 64-bit executable to be a golden bullet, though. Rather than quadrupling your FPS, consider this an important optimization for cases where 32-bit Arma can no longer 'keep up'. If you never experienced sudden performance drops, you are unlikely to notice any difference at all. However, if you did, this new version of Arma should make your experience even more splendid than ever. <\/p> <p><strong>For modders, too, there are some things to keep in mind. <\/strong>If your scenario or mod uses a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Extensions\">call extension<\/a>, the extension has be to provided both in 32-bit and 64-bit versions now. Otherwise, your game will most likely not work as expected. Unfortunately, there is no flexible way for us to work this around for you behind the scenes. 64-bit processes can only load 64-bit shared libraries (*.dll on Windows, *.so on Linux) and therefore it is expected that content creators provide them. This process should be rather straightforward, though, and we do not expect any major complication on our talented community's side.<\/p> <p>To make the transition as transparent for you as possible, we at least made it so that no changes to scripts will be required. All you need to do is build a 64-bit version of your extension and name it &lt;yourExtension&gt;_x64.dll on Windows (or &lt;yourExtension&gt;_x64.so on Linux). In other words, you add the \"_x64\" suffix to the name. Similarly, mod creators relying on <s>hacking<\/s> repurposing DirectX libraries will have to dust off their skills once again and perform their magic on 64-bit version of these libraries in similar a fashion as they did on their 32-bit counterparts back in the day. Of course, it is also worth mentioning that you should not forget to whitelist your new libraries with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.battleye.com\/\">BattlEye<\/a>!<\/p> <h3>A BIT OF FEEDBACK<\/h3> <p>Before we summon the courage to release the 64-bit exe to the wider public, we first need to gather enough feedback on how well it works outside the company walls. As confident as we are about the new exe's performance and stability, it is a rule of thumb that things impossible to happen in theory are bound to happen 50% of the time in practice. <strong>Therefore, to deliver the best possible Arma experience, we would like to kindly ask you for your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/200359-64-bit-executables-feedback\/\">feedback on the forums<\/a><\/strong><strong>.<\/strong><\/p> <p>However, although it is true the support for 64-bit has yet to hit our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Steam_Branches\">Main Branch<\/a>, we decided to give you all at least something as a small appetizer. Starting with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00062\">Update 1.66<\/a>, when run on 64-bit Windows, 32-bit Arma 3 will be able to effectively work with more than just 2 GB of memory. The current limit has been increased to 3 GB. Magic, yay! <\/p> <p>As always, we thank you all for your wonderful support over the years and are looking forward to all your observations and suggestions on this next big step in Arma's history. Have a great time playing the game and may the 64-bits be with you!<\/p> <p>Richard Biely<br>Programmer, Programming Dept.<\/p> ","created_at":"2016-12-14 16:22:35","excerpt":"<p>\u000aIntroducing 64-bit Arma 3 - what, why, and how!\u000a<\/p>","id":316,"post_header_image":null,"post_thumb":null,"public_date":"2016-12-14 16:21:00","published":"1","title":"OPREP - 64-BIT EXECUTABLES","type":"oprep","updated_at":"2016-12-14 16:52:10","url":"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-64-bit-executables"},{"animation_interval":200,"author":"Petr Kolář","content":"<p>UNIT: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lathspel\" target=\"_blank\">Petr Kolář<\/a>, Project Lead<br> TO: Arma 3 Users<br> OPSUM: Cleaning the past for a brighter future.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_clean_sweap.png\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/p> <p> In the latest Arma 3 Main-Branch Update (1.66), we finally managed to do something that many people in the community have asked for. Instead of spending time on developing new content and features, we focused solely on fixing the various issues that had been multiplying under the hood. This 'Clean Sweep', as we call it, consisted of a triage of issues reported in our systems, and fixing as many as possible over the course of one month. <\/p> <p>The result of this effort was Update 1.66, which brings a more polished game to everyone, as can be seen by the armillions of entries in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00062\">SPOTREP<\/a>. So what's a Clean Sweep and how does it work?<\/p> <h3>PURGE THE IMPURITIES<\/h3> <p>While this is the first time we communicate about it in public, this Clean Sweep was not the first (and most possibly not the last) in Arma 3's development history. The previous one was organized at the end of last year, and helped to stabilize Arma 3 as a platform, and be ready for the End Game Tournament and Apex expansion. Back then, the team managed to squash roughly 650 bugs of various intensity.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/clean_sweep_burndown.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/clean_sweep_burndown.png\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>This time, we managed to accomplish even more, and over 750 issues were resolved before the release of Update 1.66 (and still counting). With a game as complex and massive as Arma 3, plus the unpredictable variable called moddability, one can only imagine the Tanoa-like green hell of resolved tickets our Quality Assurance heroes needed to go through!<\/p> <p>But how did we organize this Clean Sweep? First our devs started 'free-for-all', when people were working according to their own plans. Later it became a more controlled fixing-mayhem, with peer reviews by fellow-developers, to make sure fixes wouldn't cause additional issues. All of that happened under the vigilant eye of our Quality Assurance department - brave lads trying to guard Fort Snapshot leading to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/rc-branch\">Release Candidate<\/a>, which was shared with the public ahead of the Main-Branch release.<\/p> <h3>CLEAN SWEPT<\/h3> <p>The start of the Clean Sweep process was relatively easy: each of our developers was asked to go through the list of issues that were assigned to him or her in our systems. They first needed to look for <strong>expired<\/strong> tickets that were not closed yet, since between now and Arma 3's release in 2013, many things have already been improved and lots of community and fellow-developers requests were handled.<\/p> <p>The second part involved a bit of planning: we asked our development leads to triage the remaining issues and evaluate what we'd be able to handle in roughly a month's time. There were a lot of seemingly trivial issues, like Recon Marksmen forgetting to include suppressors in their loadouts, or various changes to sound intensity. However, if you consider these as part of a greater whole, fixing them makes the game better for everyone.<\/p> <p>There were also some bigger tasks, such as <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/199590-dynamic-simulation-feedback\/\">Dynamic Simulation<\/a><\/strong>, which aims to improve performance in AI-heavy missions. While some of this work didn't make it into the latest update just yet, it was a direct consequence of the Clean Sweep. In addition, we managed to find time for features that still needed some finishing touches, like <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/191601-spatial-awareness-improvements\/\">Tactical Ping<\/a><\/strong>. Here, we were finally able to address the valuable feedback we received during the time it's been on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a>, so that we could set it free in the wild. <\/p><p> <div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/A3_dynSim_grid.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/A3_dynSim_grid.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/tacticool_ping.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/tacticool_ping.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <\/div> <\/p><h3> HOW TO HELP <\/h3> <p>In the near future, we plan to add new content and features to the Arma 3 Dev-Branch, and eventually those should make it over to our Main-Branch. However, this would not be possible without: 1) keeping the platform stable by spending time on maintenance, and 2) by addressing the feedback we receive from you, the players.<\/p> <p>To do so, we ask all of you to keep track of our announcements on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/140837-development-branch-changelog\/\">forums<\/a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/arma3official\">Twitter<\/a>, and switch to Dev-Branch, and possibly even RC-Branch, before the official release of an update. We try to make sure that the RC-Branch is available well ahead of the Main-Branch release, especially to provide enough time for larger mods to check their compatibility and ensure a smooth transition. Of course we do test some of the larger mods ourselves, but since we don't have access to certain server-side solutions, we're not always able to see if an update will break some things.<\/p> <p>All in all, we can't stress enough how important this is to us. Due to the complexity of the game, the many PC hardware configurations out there, and the unlimited number of mod combinations, we very much rely on players and creators for help in this regard - and we thank everyone who have been assisting us in splendid fashion so far. <\/p> <h3>CONCLUSION<\/h3> <p>To sum it all up, Clean Sweep gave us time to fix some long-standing issues in the game. While we did our best to make Update 1.66 as stable as possible, the sheer complexity of modding made it hard to cover everything, which resulted in a hotfix addressing some unforeseen problems. And, of course, despite this effort, there still remain issues in Arma 3 that need our attention.<\/p> <p>But don't be afraid, if the issue you wanted to be fixed during this period didn't get on the list now, we plan to do more Clean Sweeps in the future. Aside from that, our 'regular' updates also include plenty of fixes and improvements, and this will continue to be the case!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lathspel\" target=\"_blank\">Petr Kolář<\/a><br>Project Lead<\/p>","created_at":"2016-12-12 16:02:07","excerpt":"<p>\u000aCleaning the past for a brighter future.\u000a<\/p>","id":315,"post_header_image":null,"post_thumb":null,"public_date":"2016-12-12 16:00:00","published":"1","title":"OPREP - CLEAN SWEEP NOVEMBER 2016","type":"oprep","updated_at":"2016-12-15 13:03:16","url":"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-clean-sweep-november-2016"},{"animation_interval":200,"author":"Vojtěch Kovařič","content":"<p>FROM: High Command<br> TO: Arma 3 Users<br> UNIT: Main Branch<br> ACTIVITY: Hotfix 1.66 (selectPlayer Command, Missile Warning)<br> SIZE: ~93.4 MB \/ ~44.9 MB (depends on Apex ownership)<\/p> <h1>NOTES<\/h1> <ul> <li>Consider using the Steam client option to verify the integrity of the local game cache to avoid corrupted data after downloading this update. <\/li> <li>Consider defragmenting your HDD after downloading large updates.<\/li> <li>Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks.

For example, computing a route and following it on any terrain - be it a vanilla or a modded one - is, generally, something the AI manages to pull off on a daily basis. They are able to control multiple types of vehicle, be aware of enemies and dangerous areas, and navigate on roads and across bridges - all while avoiding collisions - but not always in the most effective manner.<\/p> <p> As the number of options for the AI grew, the number of issues, edge cases, rare configurations and parameters rose as well. Plus, with the<strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/apex\">Apex<\/a> expansion<\/strong> and its terrain, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/tanoa\">Tanoa<\/a>, having unique bridges, the amount of the tweaks necessary for smooth gameplay increased drastically. Thus, it was finally time to re-address our AI path-finding. In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00059\">Update 1.64<\/a>, we introduced a revamped, refactored and vastly improved <strong>AI driving overhaul of wheeled vehicles<\/strong>. Below, we take a closer look at where we've ended up, how we planned our route there, and what still lies ahead.<\/p> <h3>RECON &amp; OBJECTIVES<\/h3> <p>As part of the research phase, we looked at <strong>player's feedback<\/strong> from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/\">forums<\/a>, internal bug reports, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/feedback.bistudio.com\/project\/view\/1\/\">Feedback Tracker<\/a> Issues and analyses made by our designers. We concluded that not only did the immediate behavior of drivers need some improvement, but also our <strong>platform goals<\/strong> (such as being more open, friendly to modding, and clearly configurable for the scenario makers) had to be met, too. Technically speaking, we wanted to make this part of code <strong>cleaner and easier to configure<\/strong>, expand, and maintain.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/ai_path_following_1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"''We met with friends on Tanoa and went drinking on the ridge of the volcano, and then wondered who's going to bring us back to this dirty motel in Georgetown. And the only sober guy was Miller. He drives like my mother, or worse.'' - Sgt. Lucas\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/ai_path_following_1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>We also wanted an understandable separation of config definitions. Ultimately, some functions and parameters would be editable by scripts; both developers and players would have <strong>more options<\/strong> to modify AI behavior. That said, the player experience needed an improvement as well. Making AI the <strong>drivers more fluent and confident<\/strong> became a priority. We hoped to succeed by improving the survivability of vehicles, precision of their driving along the selected path, and, ultimately, their behavior in formations.<\/p> <h3>LOGISTICS &amp; PLANNING<\/h3> <p>As a first step , we made use of one of the features the <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Real_Virtuality\">Real Virtuality<\/a><\/strong> engine provides: components. A component, simply put, is an object wrapping certain functionality, which can be attached to an entity (e.g. vehicle, person, weapon or tree). We moved the whole old driving system into a new <em>AICarSteeringComponent<\/em>. This approach allows us to set up sophisticated objects from smaller elements, making systems more flexible and configurable. The refactoring itself was painfully long, but resulted in <strong>more configuration flexibility<\/strong>. The definition of a vehicle can now include feature-specific parameters, encapsulated in the Component class. This solution is also fully backwards compatible, so creating a vehicle config without the new component means the engine will revert to the AI's old method of driving instead.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/ai_path_following_2.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"''We showed Miller how to drive cars. He seems content.'' - Sgt. Julio\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/ai_path_following_2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>Encapsulation of the feature allowed us to refactor some key functions. We started with the act of steering: controlling the steering wheel, acceleration and brake pedals. We used a new controlling method and reconfigured it from scratch using the old vehicle data. We aimed to make the AI more aware of the shape of its path in the front of the car, and use<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PID_controller\"> PID controllers<\/a> for tuning the steering vector and pedals input. The system turned out to be reactive to input parameters and can adapt to different cases, which, in the end, helps with the precision of path-following.<\/p> <h3>RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT<\/h3> <p>We also made another iteration to formation behavior, making cars behave more naturally in <strong>convoy situations<\/strong>. The new formation logic uses old routines to determine the formation position for each vehicle, but also makes sure that cars are following each other properly. We made better use of the position of the leading vehicle. In short, the leader now creates a path for the next vehicle based on the historical position of the front one. <\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/ai_path_following_3.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"''There is no way this convoy will get there.'' - Cpt. Miller\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/ai_path_following_3.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>Scenario creators can now also use new commands to <strong>tweak the behavior<\/strong> (e.g. <em>setConvoySeparation<\/em> - to set a specific distance between vehicles in convoy). Some of our designers already took advantage of the new features and, based on community reactions, scenario creators are having fun with AI drivers, too. Our next step aims to convert the existing driving component from wheeled to tracked vehicles. We may see some interesting new convoy missions appear soon!<\/p> <h3> FINDING &amp; FOLLOWING <\/h3> <p> Perhaps to your surprise, one thing that hasn't changed - at least on a technical level - is the actual 'path-finding' itself. When ordered to move, each AI driver will first calculate the path to a destination point and then follow it. The first part of the algorithm is called 'path-finding' , the second '<strong>path-following<\/strong>'. The scope of our changes was mostly limited to the latter, and we avoided making changes (apart from small tweaks) to the path-finding algorithm. The reason for that is that those methods are shared between all different classes of objects in game. Specific parameters of vehicle types, like information on how costly it is to cross particular piece of terrain by particular class of vehicle, were tweaked <strong>only for wheeled vehicles<\/strong>.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/ai_path_following_4.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"''Tried to tell Miller which gear to use when going down the hill in 30 tons APC, he didn't listen to me!'' - Cpt.

During development, we encountered a large number of bugs. The mix of low-level refactoring, addition of components, and config changes made the feature more difficult to clean and finish. To provide an example of how changing one class affects the other: tweaking values for Ifrits made Tempest trucks drift around or hit every single road sign along the way in a convoy formation. We set up around <strong>30 different test cases<\/strong>: on different roads, with different vehicles, setups, waypoints, parameters of waypoints, and many more. Of course, all of them had to be retested after most iterations. <\/p> <h3> ACHIEVEMENTS &amp; CREDIT <\/h3> <p> After a long and bumpy road the new AI driving released in <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00059\">Update 1.64<\/a><\/strong>, we definitely feel it <strong>improved<\/strong> both engine capabilities and the sandbox gameplay experience. We managed to clean up a long-standing feature and refactor it in a way that makes it still backward-compatible, but also modernized and more configurable. Playing existing scenarios should be <strong>more fun<\/strong>, especially those which utilize convoys of wheeled vehicles. Better handling hopefully means that there will be more scenarios using AI-controlled vehicles - we hope to see fresh ideas emerging and to inspire awesome new game modes, too. <\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/ai_path_following_5.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"''It was a hell of a ride.'' - Maj.

By now, many of you have had a chance to play it. Some of you have even been diligently providing us with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/192300-co-op-campaign-apex-protocol\/\">feedback<\/a> on your experience, which everyone here on the Arma 3 team has been keeping a close eye on following the release.<\/p> <p>Thanks to your feedback, we've been working on some significant changes and improvements to Apex Protocol which will be making their way to you as part of Arma 3's upcoming <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/183855-release-candidate-branch-announcements\/?p=3083695\">Update 1.64<\/a>. As part of this effort, we'd like to take this opportunity to establish the motivations behind these changes in order for you to have a clearer picture - when they go live - of where we came from, where we are, and where we're going.<\/p> <h3>AFTER ACTION REPORT<\/h3> <p>Among others, Apex Protocol had 2 major goals: promote co-operative multiplayer gameplay in Arma 3, and be a driving force behind various highly-anticipated improvements to our multiplayer infrastructure. As our first official multiplayer campaign for Arma 3, it was an opportunity for us to identify and answer a series of long-standing design questions, improving the basis upon which we can build future content, both singleplayer and multiplayer. As the first official campaign we've made since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/features\/campaign\">The East Wind<\/a>, it also presented us with an opportunity to reflect upon our experience up to that point, analyzing what went well, what went wrong, and culminating in drastic improvements to our user experience, internal pipelines, and overall standard of quality.<\/p> <p><strong>But<\/strong> - and you all knew there'd be a \"but\" - it was certainly not perfect. Some players felt let down by the multiplayer focus of the campaign, expecting instead the \"singleplayer first, co-op second\" approach of our Arma 2 campaigns Harvest Red, Operation Arrowhead and Operation Black Gauntlet. Others criticized the fact that, indeed, missions could not fail in any official sense due to the lack of a limit on respawning. Other criticisms included a lack of AI subordinates occupying empty player slots, missions not using enough of the new assets introduced as part of Apex itself, saving &amp; loading being disabled, and a generally simplistic approach to mission design.<\/p> <p>A few of these criticisms are simply victims of the development process. For example, one mission in Apex Protocol originally featured NATO's new V-44 X Blackfish VTOL quite heavily, but it had to be reworked as various unforeseen circumstances resulted in the asset not being ready in time for us to release the campaign along-side the rest of Apex, avoiding the episodic, post-release method we employed with The East Wind. However, we recognize now that we missed a few things while underestimating the importance of others. The fact that missions can't be failed was an issue that we definitely failed to judge the significance of, and one that must be addressed. On the flip-side, some of these issues are a direct result of design decisions we made at the very beginning of development, especially the focus on multiplayer. To change them would be a fundamental shift in our vision for Apex Protocol, Apex itself, and in what we set out to achieve. Though things aren't perfect, we don't want to turn Apex Protocol into a Frankenstein's Monster of different, competing design visions.<\/p> <p>One thing is certain: <strong>work on Apex doesn't stop at launch<\/strong>. Far from it. Changes are inbound, Apex Protocol included. With Update 1.64 just around the corner, let's take a moment to discuss the major improvements aimed at addressing some of these issues which you, yourself, can look forward to seeing very soon.<\/p> <h3>DIFFICULTY OVERHAUL<\/h3> <p>Players on the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"\">Development Branch<\/a> have had access to improved difficulty settings for Apex Protocol <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/193730-apex-protocol-difficulty-improvements\/\">for some time now<\/a>. This effort, which began almost immediately after release, is aimed at addressing one of the most significant issues facing Apex Protocol: missions can't fail. To achieve this, we have given Hosts control over an array of settings for both Respawn and Revive, making a conscious effort to accommodate a wide range of playstyles. We also allow for players to disable both systems outright, a decision made, in part, to accommodate those using mods with their own respawn\/revive\/medical systems. Should all players be dead or incapacitated, and respawn unavailable, missions will now end in failure.<\/p> <p> <div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/difficulty_overhaul_lobby.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-2\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/difficulty_overhaul_lobby.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/difficulty_overhaul_respawn.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-2\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/difficulty_overhaul_respawn.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <\/div> <\/p> <p>The \"Limited\" Respawn setting is possibly the most significant addition here. We concluded early on that unlimited respawns went against Arma's mantra - that every bullet could be your end, and death is permanent - even though it is easily the best option for less-experienced players and public sessions. However, we also knew that disabling respawn should be reserved for veterans and those playing with mods. We had to find a middle-ground, which materialized in the form of using our existing Respawn Tickets systems. Players would share a pool of Tickets, and each completed task would award Tickets proportional to its difficulty.<\/p> <p>As mentioned above, the primary goal of Apex Protocol was to promote co-operative gameplay. What we found was that this \"sharing of resources\" put a much greater emphasis on players reviving each other over respawning, while discouraging respawning just to replenish your loadout or skip closer to the action, both of which were legitimately detrimental to the co-op experience before. Furthermore, awarding Tickets upon the completion of tasks resulted in players being more inclined to co-operate and attack the same objectives, rather than sometimes chaotically attacking any objective they want, like they may have before. Amusingly, this system has already lent itself to memorable gameplay \"snapshots\", such as surviving players hitting 0 Tickets, desperately trying to collectively push the objective and, finally, breathing a legitimate sigh of relief when \"1 TICKET AVAILABLE!\" appears on-screen.<\/p> <p>Since being deployed to the Development Branch, we've already made some notable changes based on player feedback. Players correctly pointed out that the \"Medic Only\" Revive setting is actually tied to the presence of a Medikit in the player's inventory and, furthermore, we don't have an explicit \"Medic\" class in the campaign. We do, however, have the \"Paramedic\" class. As such, the label was adjusted to \"Paramedics\" to reduce confusion. Another change was to the design of the new Respawn Menu, pictured below. While definitely not a radical design overhaul, we do consider it to have made some significant improvements to readability and user-friendliness as opposed to the original design.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/respawn_menu_old_v_new.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/respawn_menu_old_v_new.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <\/p> <h3> ADAPT &amp; OVERCOME <\/h3> <p>In the end, the team has learned a lot from the development of Apex Protocol. When we first set out on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23RoadToApex\">#RoadToApex<\/a>, we identified many significant gaps in the platform that needed to be filled, and many design questions that had to be answered, if we were to drive Arma 3 forwards. 2 years later, having successfully released our first co-op campaign for Arma 3, the changes are significant and far-reaching: we now have an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Revive_remastered\">official Revive system<\/a>, something we identified early on as critical to producing co-operative multiplayer content. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-respawn-overhaul\">Respawn Menu<\/a> was overhauled, fixing long-standing issues and providing a far superior user experience. Quick Play was introduced, allowing you to easily jump in to your favorite game modes at the click of a button. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Tasks_Overhaul\">Tasks<\/a> were completely overhauled, improving every aspect of their design and introducing Shared Objectives. Under the hood, massive optimizations to performance and networking have taken place, resulting in a much smoother and stable gameplay experience for everyone.<\/p> <p>All of these efforts were driven by the need to deliver a co-op campaign for Arma 3, a goal we have realized with the successful release of Apex Protocol. It's already one of the Arma franchise's most-played pieces of official content, with over 200,000 player hours being invested in it for the first week of release alone, beating out all of the major unofficial multiplayer modes like King of the Hill, Altis Life and Exile (for a little while, at least! :)). This was a remarkable and, truth be told, unexpected accomplishment, especially when we would open our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-the-future-of-server-browsing\">(new &amp; improved!)<\/a> Server Browser to be greeted by upwards of 60 servers hosting it per day, even outside peak hours. Equally impressive was that the campaign held stable; very few bugs were reported compared to previous content releases, especially ones that would block a mission's progress. Players moved seamlessly from mission to mission, on both hosted &amp; dedicated servers, with minimal interference. Clearly, the stability and success of the release was a substantial improvement over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/MkCcgZw0HOs\">some of our past attempts<\/a>. :) <\/p> <p>It certainly wasn't all sunshine and daisies, however, as extensively detailed above. Nonetheless, we are confident that we are in a vastly superior position to deliver high quality playable content than we were when we started. We've learned a lot about keeping players together, encouraging team work, and what it means to build stable multiplayer missions. Even so, we still need to answer questions like saving &amp; loading in multiplayer, maintaining immersion in multiplayer content, and ensuring there's enough gameplay variety so that missions don't feel repetitive. Apex Protocol's Difficulty Overhaul is just one of the ways we aim to do better post-Apex, and we look forward to what comes next.<\/p> <p>Finally, we'd like to thank you, our dedicated playerbase, for being there with us along the way. It's not over yet.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ZipperFive\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Ryan<\/a><br> Senior Designer, Design Dept.

This tech has been with us for ages, actually even in Arma 2, but it rose a discussion recently about the purpose. If we go literally deeper, the effect is used to simulate higher grass that is not rendered on distance and some sort of camouflage the grass provides to soldiers. How does it affect the character in game? The change is just a visual one from observer point of view, there is actually no part of the character in terrain, and that goes even for the geometries. As a result, there is a small difference between the actual hit points position and where it seems they are. Should we choose a different approach, there would be actually more issues - moving the geometries into terrain would drive the game physics crazy and rendering grass in high distances is something we were investigating without any reasonable outcome.\"<\/i><br><\/p><h3>LOGISTICS<br><\/h3><p>The <b>difficulty and respawn settings<\/b> in the Apex Protocol campaign have been overhauled.

Having a grenadier, autorifleman or marksman available can make all the difference.

These are currently broadcast on the communications channel you have selected for text chat and Voice-Over-Network (type via \/, speak via Caps Lock and change channel via &lt; and &gt; by default).

This is a uniquely challenging field as it can be difficult to ensure nothing gets ... lost in translation. The process starts with the developers putting in the raw texts, but then goes through a whole pipeline to end up being proofread and translated by mostly external contractors. Dedicated testing of the game in the various languages also takes place. One tricky aspect is context. It can often be difficult for an external translator to know precisely how a phrase or single word fit into the game and how they should be translated.

Some aspects received useful tweaks ahead of release, while others may still be addressed post-release. We are for example wanting to adjust the Revive bleed-out timings, so you'll have a better chance of saving your team mates. There's been debate on whether the campaign is suitable for individuals.

But there are many players out there who just cannot put in the kind of time this usually demands (nonetheless, we recommend them to try to hook up with a suitable <a href=\"https:\/\/units.arma3.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">unit<\/a> for embedded operations). We hope this campaign is another type of multiplayer content that may interest more players in military Arma gameplay.

More detail about its usage can be found on the relevant <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Publisher#Command_Line_Interface\">documentation page<\/a>. <\/p> <p>Also, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Work_Drive\">Work Drive<\/a> received the last bit of coding to reach its final state. It now handles the creation of directory junctions between the tools, the game and the samples instead of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/mapFolders\">MapFolder<\/a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/mapFolders\">s<\/a>. It can also install <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Buldozer\">Buldozer<\/a> from the diagnostic executable and configure <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Buldozer\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Buldozer<\/a> to be started from the game directory with startup parameter <em>-BuldozerNoP<\/em> (in this case, it will not be installed in the Project Space). These two last features are experimental and should only be used by advanced content creators because of some potentially unwanted side effects. <\/p> <p>Except for the above, this update is mainly focused on maintenance and some small adjustments which can be consulted in the change log below. <\/p> <p> In the event you would like to share feedback, we invite you to do so on our official channels: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/feedback.arma3.com\/\">Feedback Tracker<\/a> &amp; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/forumdisplay.php?169-ARMA-3-EDITING\">the forums<\/a>. <\/p> <h2>CHANGELOG<\/h2> <p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/233800\/\">TOOLS:<\/a><\/strong> <\/p> <ul> <li> <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Publisher\">Publisher<\/a><\/strong> <ul> <li><strong>Added: New command-line interface to publish or edit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/107410\/workshop\/\">Steam Workshop<\/a> entries (<em>PublisherCmd.exe<\/em>) <\/strong><\/li> <li>Changed: Updated overlay messages<\/li> <li>Fixed: Steam error messages are now being displayed<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Buldozer\">Buldozer<\/a><\/strong> <ul> <li><strong>Added: Support for <em>script\\initBuldozer.sqf<\/em><\/strong><\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <li> <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Tools_Launcher\">Arma 3 Tools Launcher<\/a><\/strong> <ul> <li>Added: Option to tell Work Drive to use the Arma 3 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Tools_Diag\">diagnostic executable<\/a> during the install of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Buldozer\">Buldozer<\/a> when it is possible (default is false).

This has resulted in modest improvements to the vanilla Voice-Over-Network communications and Line Drawing on the 2D map. Two additional features in development are the so-called <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReMuuf\/status\/741381966109548545\" target=\"_blank\">Squad Radar<\/a><\/b> and <b>Tactical Ping<\/b>, which you may have already encountered on branches like <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"\">Dev-Branch<\/a>. Besides assisting units to play co-operatively, we view these as optional tools to compensate for a decreased spatial awareness when compared to real life conditions. Since we know not everyone appreciates these types of helpers, they are indeed optional and \/ or linked to difficulty settings for those who accept the I\/O limitations of the PC and its peripherals for what they are. Before we expand on these two new features, we do need to let you know that after careful consideration, we have decided to <b>delay<\/b> them <b>from 1.62<\/b>. While they show great promise, the features need some additional time for testing and to resolve a few potential UI conflicts for example.<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReMuuf\/status\/741381966109548545\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p>Squad Radar is a spatial awareness indicator that visualizes important entities in your immediate vicinity.

For those who don't know, every model in the game is available in several (pre-made) LODs, selected by the renderer based on factors like overall performance, distance, importance and more. This is done in many games, since rendering everything at maximum detail all the time is not feasible yet (especially when using kilometers of viewing distance). Senior Programmer <em>Lukáš Bábíček<\/em> has enabled a first version of <strong>dissolve LOD blending<\/strong>, which aims to make the transition between LODs less sudden, less aggressive and less noticeable. Effectively you will see a smooth dithered blend during the switch, which we feel makes the scene calmer. There is a performance cost to this approach, although our own automated benchmarks have not shown a significant hit. We'll be going over your experiences to determine the best approach going forward.<\/p> <h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3> <p>Our <strong>inventory<\/strong> tech now supports some new capabilities that allow for advanced <strong>integrated items<\/strong>. This was applied to some of the high-tech Apex Special Forces gear, but may also be very useful to modders. Designer <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/user\/835204-solzenicyn\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Radko Voda<\/em><\/a>, who has cooperated with Senior Programmer <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/japapatramtara\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Jan Mareček<\/em><\/a> on this, goes over the details with us: <em>\"Integrated items represent a new type of equipment that combine the functionality of multiple different items into one. Let's consider the new Special Purpose Helmet used by CSAT Special Operators as an example.This helmet has integrated night and thermal vision modes that you can cycle freely without any other attachments or items being equipped. Also it occupies both the helmet slot as well as the slot for the NVGs in your inventory. When you equip some other helmet or NVG this helmet will be removed just like if you would have replaced any other item. However, when you equip this helmet, it will remove any items from both helmet and NVG slots alike. The default helmet slot is equipped as per usual and additional occupied slots are indicated by a yellow background and the item icon with 50% opacity.<\/em><\/p> <p><em>To achieve this functionality we have introduced a new type of configurable parameter: subItems[] = {\"item_class\"}; When you put this parameter into the class of some item, you can integrate some other items into it simply by specifying their class names in the parameter field. However, this is currently working only for a limited selection of item combinations. You can integrate NVG and Radio items into Helmets and you can make a Vest that occupies the Backpack slot as well. We would like to gradually extend this functionality as far as possible, but due to technical limitations of the existing item implementation we cannot guarantee that it will be possible for all items in the end. Nevertheless, we found even the currently possible combinations quite promising for the creation of amazing new pieces of equipment.\"<\/em><\/p> <p>That's all for this week. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/99_RFar\/status\/742986477668290561\" target=\"_blank\">Enjoy the summer vibe<\/a> on Tanoa!<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/99_RFar\/status\/742986477668290561\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> ","created_at":"2016-06-28 14:38:04","excerpt":"<p>Revive, LOD Blending, Integrated Items<\/p>\u000a","id":281,"post_header_image":null,"post_thumb":null,"public_date":"2016-06-28 21:32:00","published":"1","title":"SITREP #00162","type":"sitrep","updated_at":"2016-06-28 19:36:33","url":"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00162"},{"animation_interval":200,"author":"Joris-Jan van 't Land","content":"<p>FROM: High Command<br \/> TO: Arma 3 Users<br \/> INFO: Armaversary, Main Menu Overhaul, Vehicle-in-Vehicle Transport, Vehicle Path-Following<br \/> PRECEDENCE: Flash<\/p> <h3>SITUATION<\/h3> <p>The first week of <strong>pre-release public testing<\/strong> of the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/apex\" target=\"_blank\">Apex<\/a> sandbox<\/strong> has <strong>proven<\/strong> once again the <strong>value<\/strong> of this approach.

One of the goals was simply to apply a fresh coat of paint, as we've done for the game itself with the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-visual-upgrade\">Visual Upgrade<\/a>. After a few years of playing the game, and with more years to go, having a splendid new entry point to gameplay was desired. In addition, several of our designers have taken a look at the User eXperience of the interface and made tweaks to how elements are arranged, presented and interacted with. One part of this was to re-focus on the center of the screen (most other displays were also centralized). This is also where we placed several visually-pleasing spotlight tiles for the content we want to promote (or mods want to promote!).<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KarelMoricky\/status\/743065536255397888\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <p>Another aspect of the Main Menu is the terrain-specific cutscene played in the background. Throughout the Arma series there have been various approaches. Before Apex, our terrains showed a drone-like feed with combat going on in the distance. Now we've gone with a series of static scenes that showcase the environment, and provide more stable performance at the same time. Of course mods can tweak the UI and these scenes.

After introducing features like Sling Loading for helicopters, we wanted to offer another important capability: carrying vehicles inside larger vehicles. This will open another avenue for commanders to move their assets across large distances, for example between the islands of Tanoa. The first version of <strong>Vehicle-in-Vehicle Transport<\/strong> is available on <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a>, where it will be iterated for a little while before taking it to other versions. So far, the new VTOLs have been prepared to load any suitable vehicle in the vanilla sandbox, from the new LSVs to existing light armored vehicles. In some cases you may even load up multiple vehicles. In the future we'd like to prepare our larger pre-Apex aircraft for this as well, but that requires some additional work. Cargo vehicles do not need setting up for the most part, as load capacity is determined based on their actual bounding box dimensions and weight. One very cool aspect of this feature is the ability to eject cargo vehicles mid-flight and have them be parachuted down (depending on altitude and pilot skill!).<\/p> <p>In our wildest dreams, we envisioned this feature to also mean you would drive up a vehicle ramp and park the vehicle manually. However, after experimenting with this and similar approaches, we learned it wouldn't be feasible to deliver, given reasonable resources. These attempts caused complex problems with AI, animations and physics. We want our engine-based features to be fully available for: AI, commanding, waypoints, multiplayer, Eden Editor, Zeus, mods, etc. That's why we've decided to implement the feature in a more abstracted way. For technical details and available modding options, check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Vehicle_in_Vehicle_Transport\" target=\"_blank\">Community Wiki documentation<\/a> (more information coming, including script command references).

Programmer-Designer duo <em>Tomáš Nezval<\/em> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aluc4rd\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Karel Kališ<\/em><\/a> are monitoring for any reported issues and potential tweaks.

Before we describe this effort more, we should make it clear that this tech will not be part of the 1.62 update yet. It requires more work and testing of all content. Once finalized, our hope is that especially <strong>vehicle path-following<\/strong> will have improved. It should teach AI to navigate through narrow roads and urban areas more effectively. Other AI challenges being looked into are formation holding and convoy driving. There is also a powerful new modding opportunity as it allows a per-vehicle behavior to be configured via a new driving component in vehicle simulation.

But it turns out some distribution and ownership issues are delaying your hands-on exploration a little longer. We are liaising with our Steam partners to get this resolved quickly, because we know the game build itself works well. For unknown reasons the Steam API is feeding incorrect ownership status to the game, and it's also refusing to download the Tanoa data to you. Know that there is nothing you can do on your side to solve this. We're pursuing a solution as soon as possible. We would also like to remind you of the type of build you're getting by using Dev-Branch. This is not and has never been a final release state. Please take a look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">branch overview<\/a> of limitations, and consider whether you'd like to jump in or wait for the full release. Of particular note are the <strong>expected large daily updates<\/strong>. Due to the EBO (Encrypted PBO) files not being friends with Steam's delta patching, you can easily see hundreds, if not thousands, of MBs getting pushed around. To tide you over, enjoy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RunKiT2svRM\" target=\"_blank\">this sneak preview video<\/a> by our very own CEO: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/maruksp\/status\/739977073691762688\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Marek Španěl<\/em><\/a>.<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BattleRoyaleMod\/status\/739886146721714177\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <p>But let's assume the access issue gets solved soon; then all Apex owners get to explore the entire Tanoa terrain. We're very proud of how it has turned out even given the polish that's yet to be done. It looks great, feels authentic, and provides for a plethora of gameplay possibilities. Please share your <strong>feedback<\/strong> with us on <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/191389-tanoa-discussion-dev-branch\/\" target=\"_blank\">the forums<\/a>, and report glitches on the <a href=\"https:\/\/feedback.bistudio.com\/project\/view\/1\/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedback Tracker<\/a>.

Please also allow us to respectfully ask you to mark any media you share with some indication that this is still a work-in-progress version, so that it may be clear for future viewers. Finally, since exploration is such a key part, consider not sharing some of the unique locations too prominently. Let eventual Apex owners be wowed by the locales our environment designers have worked so hard on. But most importantly: <strong>have a lot of fun playing around in this new green sandbox!<\/strong><\/p> <p><div class=\"video-wrapper\" id=\"RunKiT2svRM\"><div class=\"absolute-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RunKiT2svRM\" data-video=\"RunKiT2svRM\" data-container=\".video-wrapper#RunKiT2svRM\" data-removeitem=\".video-wrapper#RunKiT2svRM .btn\" class=\"btn btn-play\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-play\"><\/span><\/a><\/div><img src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/RunKiT2svRM\/maxresdefault.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/div><\/p> <h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3> <p>With parts of <a href=\"https:\/\/store.bistudio.com\/products\/arma3-apex\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apex<\/strong><\/a> coming your way on <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a>, we should explain how <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-content-licensing\"><strong>Content Licensing<\/strong><\/a> will work with regards to our established <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bistudio.com\/blog\/roadmap-14-15-dlc-strategy-blog\" target=\"_blank\">DLC strategy<\/a>. Let's get the easy parts out of the way first: all vehicles, weapons and character gear will work as it did in previous DLC. You will be able to try them freely in VR Arsenal \/ Garage. When you encounter and use them outside of that mode as non-owner, you will meet various limitations and messages. Various decorative props, as well as all new features and technologies are free to every Arma 3 player out there! This is made possible thanks to the continued awesome support of the full player-base.<\/p> <p>The difference is the Tanoa terrain itself. Here you really need to own Apex to gain access, whether in the editor or multiplayer or any other avenue. Not only that, but the Tanoa-specific data, such as environmental objects and structures, is only downloaded to Apex owners. This is a necessary departure from the previous approach where everyone shared the exact same data-set. Practically what this means is that you should carefully consider including such assets in your custom content, because non-owners may struggle to play it. The motivations for doing this are the sheer size and scale of Tanoa, and the investment behind it. We did not find a reasonable way of implementing a try-before-you-buy approach here. In addition, the extra ~6 GB of data was too large for us to force onto every Arma 3 player's installation. We think that once you explore Tanoa, you'll clearly see the years of effort our team has put into it, are worth it!<\/p> <p>Shortly after the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00056\"><strong>1.60 update<\/strong><\/a>, there was a <strong>small hotfix<\/strong> to address several miscellaneous issues discovered after rolling out the build to everyone.

One of the things many of you immediately spotted were temporary compatibility issues on custom terrains. This was expected and done after a discussion with modders so that they could more effectively leverage the Visual Upgrade for their terrains. It did mean that full backward-compatibility could not be preserved, but a number of popular terrains have already been updated meanwhile. For the technically-minded among us, this means that the <em>CAWorld<\/em> base configuration class contains the VU parameters so that they can be easily inherited by any terrain.

To deliver on this, we introduced <strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Work_Drive\" target=\"_blank\">Work Drive<\/a> <\/strong> late last year, which has been updated over the past month and it is now the only tool to prepare and maintain the Project Directory. All previously used batch scripts are now simply calling Work Drive with the appropriate parameters.<\/p> <p>Speaking of the Project Directory (Drive); it's a new term to designate something most of you know: it’s the substitute drive P known as \"P Drive\". As explained in a previous <a href=\"http:\/\/tom4897.info\/blog\/2014\/06\/arma-3-tools-p-drive-devp\/\" target=\"\">personal blog<\/a>, the P drive is a concept. In short, it’s the file structure for the game from the game's perspective, P being its root directory. To give an example, the file <em>data_f_mark.pbo<\/em> is physically located in<em> \\Mark\\Addons<\/em> in the file tree. However, once loaded, the game will set its mounting point to <em>\\A3\\data_f_mark<\/em>, which corresponds to the prefix of the PBO file. To sum up, P:\\ is a representation of the working directory of the game, from the perspective of the game.<\/p> <p>Like previously mentioned (in various places like the forums or older <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/techrep\" target=\"_blank\">TECHREPs<\/a>), Work Drive is a tool designed to replace the previously scripted systems in order to provide a more reliable way to manage the work drive (P) and its content. Its first <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/techrep-00026\" target=\"_blank\">iteration<\/a> was only able to manage the well-known P drive and to install Buldozer. It did this from any location (source \/ destination). In the recent development updates, the tool received more abilities:<\/p> <ul> <li>Mount and Dismount any substitute drive (<a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/P_drive\" target=\"_blank\">mapDisk<\/a>)<\/li> <li>Maintain Buldozer (<a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/P_drive\" target=\"_blank\">DevP<\/a>)<\/li> <li>Extract game data to any Project Directory (<a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/FuturaToP\" target=\"_blank\">FuturaToP<\/a>)<\/li> <li>Create the symbolic links (<a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/mapFolders\" target=\"_blank\">mapFolders<\/a>)<\/li> <\/ul> <p>An important note is that Work Drive will select the main install of the game as source. The destination directory will be the same as your project space b y default , as defined from the <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Tools_Launcher\" target=\"_blank\">launcher of the tools<\/a> ( <a href=\"http:\/\/tom4897.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/picture1.png\" target=\"_blank\">Preferences-&gt;Settings<\/a> - <em>CTRL+E<\/em>). However, unlike the previous behavior (using the install directory of the tools), if no custom directory is defined, a default one will be used in the document folder of the current user (<em>...\\Documents\\Arma 3 Projects<\/em>). This is done in order to avoid any potential conflict with the updates of the tools.<\/p> <p>A few facts about Work Drive:<\/p> <ul> <li>It takes around 4 minutes to extract the game data from and to a SSD (~12 minutes with a HDD).<\/li> <li>Work Drive runs multiple tasks in parallel.<\/li> <li>The faster your hard drive, the faster the process will be.<\/li> <li>In case of an update of the game, it takes usually between 1 and 2 minutes to update the extracted data.<\/li> <li>Work Drive won’t update a folder which already is up to date.<\/li> <\/ul> <p>In the upcoming updates, this new default environment will be adjusted and polished. Your user feedback is valuable - if you have any feedback, please come and share it in <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/190585-project-space-work-drive-and-game-data\/\" target=\"_blank\">this forum topic<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Besides the above, some other tools have been updated.

Being able to <strong> choose your gear and where to respawn clearly<\/strong> and <strong> back in-game fast<\/strong> is essential. As you may have already seen on <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a>, the screen started to look a little bit different a while ago.<\/p> <p>Besides major changes to the layout itself, the underlying base of scripts is being modified too. This is not only to remove certain limitations of the old system, but to allow us to bring in a few new features. What is happening to our good old Respawn Screen then? The following lines will reveal everything behind the new respawn system from both a visual and functional perspective.<\/p> <h3>USER INTERFACE<\/h3> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/old_respawn.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/old_respawn.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>Aside from the new content for <a href=\"https:\/\/store.bistudio.com\/products\/arma3-apex\" target=\"_blank\">Apex<\/a> that is being crafted, we are also focused on multiplayer systems to support our upcoming co-op campaign and to improve the multipayer gameplay more broadly. Without any doubt, the <strong>Respawn Screen<\/strong> is an inseparable part. With a vision of making the whole screen <strong>easier to use<\/strong> we started by decomposing the big and slightly cumbersome carousel dialog into something <strong>more compact<\/strong>.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/new_respawn.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/new_respawn.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The next step was to accommodate the <strong>full screen map<\/strong> as a primary navigation tool for position selection. All information is now laid out in a <strong>single panel<\/strong> allowing you to see clearly where and what loadout you are respawning with when the time is up.<\/p> <p>Speaking of <strong>remaining time<\/strong>, this is one of the most prominent elements on the screen now. In case you don't want to hypnotize the seconds to run faster and wait impatiently until they turn into a big button to click on, just enable the option to respawn automatically when the countdown ends. Meanwhile this seems-to-be-never-ending waiting, you can still experience the ongoing battle via an improved <strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/EG_Spectator_Mode\" target=\"_blank\">Spectator mode<\/a> <\/strong> that was introduced during the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-end-game-tournament\" target=\"_blank\">End Game Tournament<\/a> .<\/p> <h3>ROLE SELECTION<\/h3> <p>One of the most significant changes is the <strong>role selection<\/strong>. On the previous Respawn Screen, the loadout itself determined both the role and the equipment. To make it more versatile and easier to navigate through, we've brought a new layer above the <strong>loadouts<\/strong> by sorting them into <strong>roles<\/strong>. This move for example lets two players play as a marksman but have a different type of rifle equipped.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/loadout_details.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/loadout_details.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>Also, the resulting function of a player after his or her respawn is more clear regardless of the chosen loadout. To prevent a situation where you are suddenly playing in a group composed solely of medics after a first round of respawns, scenario designers can limit the number of players for a given role.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, they can create custom roles and loadouts. The loadout preview is condensed to represent only the most important items, namely primary weapon (including optics), launcher and special items (medkit, toolkit, UAV terminal) while you can still see the rest of inventory on demand.<\/p> <h3>CUSTOMIZATION AND DOCUMENTATION<\/h3> <p>We are aware of the enormous number and variability of <strong>user-created scenarios<\/strong> and we understand this screen might not be suitable for every single one of them. As this new solution replaces the old one, it still remains scripted. Therefore, it is under <strong>full control<\/strong> of designers and can be customized to fulfill the specific needs of the scenario, or it doesn't have to be used at all. The same applies to spectating functionality. Documentation is ready for you on our <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Respawn:_New_Respawn_Screen\" target=\"_blank\">Community Wiki<\/a>.<\/p> <p>In this overhaul, we've aimed for an easier to use layout while providing space for bigger features like roles or the spectator camera, and even for tiny enhancements like automatic respawn and more apparent location icons on the map.

Doing this while locations aren't yet populated, or the thousands of placed objects don't yet have final Levels Of Detail, could skew results. A set of <strong>rendering optimizations<\/strong> by Senior Programmer <em>Lukáš Bábíček<\/em> has now come online, covering areas like preparing the scene for rendering in smarter ways, aggregating the terrain grid, drawing distant objects that have become reduced to mere pixels, LOD-handling, calculating terrain shadows, etc. Even though these optimizations were benchmarked on Tanoa, they can definitely help on other terrains. But there are risks also. It may be that one type of scene now works better, while another runs worse. Or various kinds of visual glitching may have become more prominent. We'd like to hear your own observations and measurements. Please note that the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a> build does have some additional performance impacts compared to main branch (diagnostics e.g.).

Finding a suitable multiplayer server can be quite time-consuming, especially when you're new to Arma 3. There are many things to consider, like custom modes, required mods and servers with special rules. While we've recently added an improved <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-the-future-of-server-browsing\">Server Browser<\/a> to the <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Launcher\" target=\"_blank\">Launcher<\/a>, with powerful filters to find suitable sessions, we also want to cater to those players with little time or awareness of the varied multiplayer scene. The idea behind the new Quick Play display in the game is to get you playing with as little user input as possible. You simply pick a desired game type, maximum ping and searching method - then the game will try to get you into a server automatically. Importantly, this system <strong>takes into consideration the mod mix<\/strong> you're using, so it will only connect you to servers that are compatible. To make it very clear: this is not intended to replace the existing browser(s), but to be a companion tool. This also is a first version, and please be aware of limited <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/servers\" target=\"_blank\">server availability<\/a> during RC testing.

Its 1.5 version brings great new improvements to the Server Browser, such as more robust handling of various types of required (server) mods and DLC detection. It even sports partial support for non-Workshop mods. A list of the specific changes is available <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/140837-development-branch-changelog\/page-39#entry3019839\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>. There is one particular thing to highlight, since it will appease many of you. Until now, due to technical limitations in how Steam handles <a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/107410\/workshop\/\" target=\"_blank\">Workshop<\/a> content, you'd often have duplicates of mods on your harddrives. The Launcher team has now found a way to <strong>utilize mods directly from the Workshop cache<\/strong>. That means the Launcher will also delete the copies it had created in the Arma 3 install folder (those are no longer needed). Jiří adds a warning for advanced users who tried to work around the issue themselves by deleting or otherwise manipulating the cache: <em>\"If you had developed the habit of deleting the Workshop cache files, please stop doing so. After this update, you would be effectively be removing the actual mod files. Only the first time Launcher 1.5 is started, it will attempt to restore the Workshop cache with files from the Arma 3 folder. Afterwards, this fix will not be possible without a re-download (verifying integrity of game cache).\"<\/em><\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jiripolasekcom\/status\/728277144900620289\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <p>In preparation of new addon identification features (mainly for <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Eden_Editor\" target=\"_blank\">Eden Editor<\/a> - we'll have more details for you soon), we are <strong>revamping all <em>CfgPatches<\/em> classes<\/strong>; the part of the game's config which is responsible for the load order of configuration files. We are unifying the way these classes are named, which results in some new classes and some obsolete ones. The obsolete classes will still be available in-game for backwards compatibility, meaning that there shouldn't be any issues in the long term. However, once these changes appear on Dev-Branch, scenarios created in that version of the game might not be compatible with the main version of the game until the next main branch update (1.60).<\/p> <p>Having previously reported on phases 1 and 2 of the <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Difficulty_Overhaul\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Difficulty Overhaul<\/strong><\/a>, we can now say that the <strong>3rd<\/strong> and <strong>final phase<\/strong> is live on Dev-Branch.

You'll be happy to know that this effort includes our Marketing Communications people working on various avenues to shed more light on the expansion. Over the next two months, we'll finally be showing more about the assets, features and the Tanoa crown jewel. At the moment we don't yet have a concrete timeline for staging the components to <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a> (besides what was already released on the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/RoadToApex\" target=\"_blank\"><em>#RoadToApex<\/em><\/a> of course!). Our usual approach is to stage Sandbox assets (vehicles, weapons, characters, props, Tanoa) in several phases first and Playable Content (co-op campaign) last. Features sneak in continuously throughout, as they have for the past while. Once we decide on the specifics, we'll be letting you know via our usual channels.<\/p> <h3>INTELLIGENCE<\/h3> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Dslyecxi\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Andrew \"Dslyecxi\" Gluck<\/em><\/a>, we've published another entry in the <strong>Community Guide<\/strong> video series. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9CuBMsHAtFw\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>\"Reconnaissance\"<\/strong><\/em><\/a> episode deals with methods for conducting recon and why you would benefit from doing it in the first place. Andrew describes it as <em>\"looking for the enemy in a low-profile manner\"<\/em>, which can be useful regardless of your play style or favorite mode. It will allow you to get an understanding of the tactical situation before you execute a plan of action. Tools of the trade include: binoculars, magnified scopes, remote cameras, UAVs, UGVs, recon helicopters and operators on the ground.

Some of the Intel presented may be outdated, but the overal knowledge contained within the series is definitely still worth your time.<\/p> <h3>OPERATIONS<\/h3> <p>The splendid environment team, led by <em>Martin Pezlar<\/em>, still has a lot of work ahead of itself, cutting their way through the 'green hell' of <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/tanoa\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tanoa<\/strong><\/a>. As a sign of good progress, they have recently requested thorough <strong>sector testing<\/strong> from our hard-working Quality Assurance testers. The terrain is divided into 8 big sectors, which consist of a total of 32 sub-areas. Many of those are now undergoing rigorous and detailed testing by the ladies and gentlemen in the QA teams, for which we thank them! They are focusing on a broad range of issues so that we can fix them ahead of release. To give you an impression of what they're scanning for: misplaced objects, weeds growing where they shouldn't, missing textures, inconsistent visual appearance, satellite map blending errors, collision problems, AI navigation glitches, road and path network disconnections, terrain mesh irregularities, 2D map topography mistakes, and more. As further sectors are made ready by Martin's team, they too are submitted for testing. At the same time, Tanoa is being set up for its <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-visual-upgrade\">Visual Upgrade<\/a> lighting configuration. Situated in a different part of the world, there are noticeable differences compared to Altis and Stratis. Slowly but surely, and with excellent cooperation with our artists and other departments, the archipelago is made ready for your eager exploration.<\/p> <h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3> <p><strong>Hotfixes<\/strong> for <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00055\">update 1.58<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/techrep-00029\">Arma 3 Tools<\/a><\/strong> were published to the respective main branches last Thursday.

This appears to be an issue when using the <em>system<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3:_Custom_Memory_Allocator\" target=\"_blank\">memory allocator<\/a>. Most of these users confirm that the issue is solved by switching to another allocator (e.g. TBB4). Regardless, we believe we have a fix, and we're testing it in-house.<\/li> <li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Difficulty_Overhaul\" target=\"_blank\">Difficulty Overhaul<\/a> mostly just caused confusion, which was a matter of re-configuration for server administrators. Tips and work-arounds are being discussed in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/arma\/comments\/4gcecp\/psa_for_server_admins_on_how_to_manage_158\/\" target=\"_blank\">this thread<\/a> on the Arma subreddit. Actual bugs in the implementation are not yet confirmed, but are being investigated.<\/li> <li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.battleye.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">BattlEye<\/a> started kicking clients who took too long to download custom scenarios. This was temporarily mitigated by setting a longer timeout, but a proper fix is being sought. The silver lining is that these changes to the BE implementation lay the groundwork for support in the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/ports\">Linux and Mac ports<\/a>.<\/li> <li>We're also processing (modded server) crash reports.<\/li> <\/ul> <p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/233800\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tools<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/390500\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Samples<\/strong><\/a> also have their <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/techrep-00028\">change log<\/a>, and a very nice overview of the changes written by R&amp;D Lead <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tom_48_97\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Julien Vida<\/em><\/a>.

In celebration of this effort - and<strong> to showcase just how easy it can be to discover, install, and maintain custom content - we're releasing our very own '<a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=669962280\" target=\"_blank\">official mod<\/a>'<\/strong>. We'd like to talk a bit about what modding means to <em>Arma 3<\/em>, introduce the mod itself, and review the official tools and resources available to creators.<\/p> <h3>A HISTORY OF MODDING<\/h3> <p>At heart, <em>Arma<\/em> is a combined arms military game with a distinctive commitment to authentic combat on a massive scale; however, for many of our players, it's also <a href=\"https:\/\/units.arma3.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">much more besides<\/a>. Hand in hand with a passionate and varied community, our open architecture and long-standing commitment to custom content has nurtured an incredible range of mods. And, with <em>Arma 3<\/em>, we've set out to further strengthen our vision of the game as a 'platform'.<\/p> <p>Be it <span>t<\/span>he introduction of our <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Launcher\" target=\"_blank\">Game Launcher<\/a>, the integration of <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/workshop\/browse?appid=107410\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Workshop<\/a>, or - just recently - the creation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/top-10-arma-3-eden-update-eden-3d-editor\" target=\"_blank\">Eden 3D Editor<\/a>, the last 3 years of development have further deepened our commitment to User-Generated Content. <strong>The 'official mod' we're making available serves to demonstrate these advancements and, we hope, <\/strong><strong>help even more players discover the possibilities of custom content<\/strong>.<\/p> <h3>HELLO, ADR-97<\/h3> <div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_weapons_mod_1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_weapons_mod_1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_weapons_mod_2.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_weapons_mod_2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_weapons_mod_3.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_weapons_mod_3.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <\/div> <p>The 'ADR-97 Weapon Pack' consists of a collection of variants of the ADR-97 submachine gun, which we're making available on the <a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/arma3official\/myworkshopfiles\/\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 Official Steam Workshop<\/a> for everyone to download for free. A lightweight, highly manoeuvrable firearm with a high rate of fire (plus a distinctive 50-round mag atop of the weapon), the ADR comes with inbuilt collimator sights - but some variants can also be fitted with custom optics, too.<\/p> <p>The mod was actually created by one of our very own Programmers, Jakub Horyna (aka BXBX), in his spare time. Together with the help of a few colleagues - thanks in particular to Project Lead, Petr Kolář (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lathspel\" target=\"_blank\">Pettka<\/a>) for the config work, and Senior Animator <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_psmk_\" target=\"_blank\">Paweł Smolewski<\/a>&nbsp;for a splendid new reload animation - <em>Arma 3<\/em> players can download this (<em>Stargate SG-1<\/em>-inspired) beauty in just a few clicks. <strong>To help explain the process more clearly, we also put together a <a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/B1Zz7xHlAO8\" target=\"_blank\">short tutorial video<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p> <div class=\"video-wrapper\" id=\"B1Zz7xHlAO8\"><div class=\"absolute-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=B1Zz7xHlAO8\" data-video=\"B1Zz7xHlAO8\" data-container=\".video-wrapper#B1Zz7xHlAO8\" data-removeitem=\".video-wrapper#B1Zz7xHlAO8 .btn\" class=\"btn btn-play\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-play\"><\/span><\/a><\/div><img src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/B1Zz7xHlAO8\/maxresdefault.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/div> <h3>MODOCRACY<\/h3> <p><strong>To find out more about how to create and download mods, be sure to check out our handy <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/workshop101\" target=\"_blank\">'Workshop 101' guide<\/a><\/strong>.

Recently, some of you have asked us to maintain the compatibility between the main branch of the game and the development branch of the tools. The latter is meant for experimentation and in some cases, it uses the technologies only available in the <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/140837-development-branch-changelog\/\" target=\"_blank\">development branch of game<\/a>, regardless what the status of its main branch is.<\/p> <p>In short, when a new technology <span>is introduced to the <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/140837-development-branch-changelog\/\" target=\"_blank\">development branch of the game<\/a> and<\/span> this implies a change at the tools level (Recent cases: <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/169362-tools-development-branch-changelog\/?p=2976243\" target=\"_blank\">FontToTGA<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/169362-tools-development-branch-changelog\/?p=2977657\" target=\"_blank\">Binarize<\/a>), the tools are updated accordingly. This allows the content creators to test their work in-game with the upcoming features.<\/p> <p>Moving on to the heart of this update, terrain creators will be happy to know that we did a bit of work about the object manipulation with <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Terrain_Builder\" target=\"_blank\">Terrain Builder<\/a><\/strong>. The most noticeable is the <strong>new diagnostic tool<\/strong> which is able to detect duplicated (over-layered) objects and offer some action for those. Some more <strong>issues<\/strong> have been <strong>addressed<\/strong>, such as the inaccuracy of the angle when rotating an object on the world axis or the tiny freezes of <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Buldozer\" target=\"_blank\">Buldozer<\/a> while manipulating multiple objects.<\/p> <p>Another important point is a change in the <strong>serialization of the layers<\/strong>. The impact of this change is that it makes previous versions of <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Terrain_Builder\" target=\"_blank\">Terrain Builder<\/a> unable to open the new layer format. Consider making a backup of your layers and tell us if you encounter any issue with the layers, especially if it's loaded but no objects are placed. Note that a backup of the old layer file (if it is prior this update) is made on opening of a project.<\/p> <p>This update was also an occasion to consolidate and polish <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Work_Drive\" target=\"_blank\">Work Drive<\/a><\/strong>, which was introduced in the previous update. It is now able to manage any work drive, meaning it can handle any drive letter from any source directory and setup <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Buldozer\" target=\"_blank\">Buldozer<\/a> in this directory. As mentioned on various community channels, it will eventually replace all scripts used to manage the \"<em>drive P<\/em>\" and its content. During the upcoming weeks, it will become a substitute to <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/mapFolders\" target=\"_blank\">mapfolders<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/FuturaToP\" target=\"_blank\">FuturaToP<\/a>, which will remain until the following update.<\/p> <p>Speaking of the d<em>rive P<\/em>, despite the fact it is possible to use the install directory of the tools as source for this drive, <span>we would like to remind you that it is recommended to define a custom directory to avoid potential conflicts with the updates (in other words: an update of the tools might alter your project(s)). Also, bear in mind that we might remove the possibility of such 'risky' setup.<\/span><\/p> <p>The most curious of you will find more details in the changelog.

For Arma 3's 1.0 release we <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bistudio.com\/blog\/arma-3-campaign-deployed-across-free-dlc-episodes\" target=\"_blank\">decided<\/a> that we needed to split up the campaign into 3 episodes (not counting the <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/bootcamp\" target=\"_blank\">Bootcamp<\/a> Prologue). This also meant that technically these episodes were released as 3 separate campaigns. It's our desire to now finally <strong>merge<\/strong> these into 1 campaign for presentation purposes. For anyone new jumping into the game, this would offer a more streamlined and logical experience. There is however one very important caveat to be aware of: <strong>existing campaign saves will not work after this!<\/strong> That would mean you have from now until 1.60's release (and technically one more update after that given the Legacy Build) to finish your current session.

This naturally comes up whenever graphical fidelity is discussed, so we'll explain <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00139\">again<\/a> how we feel this upgrade can affect overall performance. The lighting changes themselves should not have an impact. Then there are a few changed technologies that are not optional and in our tests can have a small effect, namely the new shore shader, multi-component fog and previously released <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Parallax_Map\" target=\"_blank\">parallax map<\/a> improvements. Finally, the Screen Space Reflections used on water are actually expensive, but they are optional. It's also important to remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a> is not the best performance indicator. This build contains more diagnostics and may be spamming more RPT log errors for example. The 2GB update also may have caused fragmentation on non-SSD drives, so consider running a defrag.<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alberto_camu\/status\/719541705926688768\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <p>We will continue to look for optimization opportunities across the board, but it would not be realistic to expect a 'magic bullet' leap forward in Arma 3's lifetime.

It has been decided that our company will first tackle this in the new Enfusion engine, as its rendering pipeline is more compatible.

Although you are going to see the difference on first sight (<strong>available right now on <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a>, and currently pencilled in - for everyone, for free - in Update 1.60, on the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/RoadToApex\" target=\"_blank\">#RoadToApex<\/a><\/strong>), technology-wise, there is a lot going on under the new and vivid hood, which we'd like to share with our community.<\/p> <p>In particular, we'd like to discuss some of the specific changes to lighting \/ HDR settings, tone mapping, clouds, sea shader and our brand new reflections tech. Maybe even more importantly, we also want to share some of the new options available to our community to set up their game, and provide tips for our talented modders about what tweaks they may need to make to make their own creations look just as splendid.<\/p> <p>But, before we dig into the details, let's take a look at our underlying motivations, and answer the question: <em>why did we make such a change<\/em>?<\/p> <h3>ROAD TO APEX<\/h3> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>There are many reasons for the changes, but <strong>our main goal was to maintain a high quality of the whole game and being prepared for the release of <em><a href=\"https:\/\/store.bistudio.com\/products\/arma3-apex\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 Apex<\/a><\/em><\/strong>. The lush archipelago of <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/tanoa\" target=\"_blank\">Tanoa<\/a> would stand out compared to the relatively muted landscape of <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/features\/terrain\" target=\"_blank\">The Republic of Altis &amp; Stratis<\/a>, and even assets that were great on older islands would not fit in. We didn't want any artificial coloration of scenes for story purposes alone; rather, we decided to bring the whole game closer to real life.<\/p> <p>With the help of references we gathered for our terrains, another goal was to make the game more photo-realistic, which was previously possible only with post-processes. More in depth, if you looked into details of color scale in the game, you might have noticed a distinctive red tint - we decided to make the scale broader and more balanced.<\/p> <h3>UNDER THE HOOD<\/h3> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_LightSetup.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_LightSetup.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>The primary change is a new setting of lighting conditions and improved way that our High Dynamic Range (HDR) tech handles light in the scene. This required a ton of tweaks to both materials and textures of all vegetation, buildings and even surfaces of the islands.<\/p> <p>Added to that, <strong>we have even taken a closer look on the sea with new surface reflections<\/strong> (as you may have seen in our <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/tanoa\" target=\"_blank\">Tanoa reveal<\/a>), and we went up to the sky to adjust clouds to be more authentic than ever. Not to mention, we have adjusted the rainbow,<em> don't forget about the rainbow<\/em>.

We had to adjust the light setting accordingly, which required several iterations, but the new light and aperture configuration should now work correctly with the technology. You may see the biggest difference at night, but even dusk and dawn should look much better now.<\/p> <\/div><\/div> <div class=\"box box-black btn-block border-bottom-grey\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseClouds\" class=\"collapsed btn-collapse text-left\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-plus\"><\/span><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-minus\"><\/span> CLOUDS<\/a><\/div> <div id=\"collapseClouds\" class=\"collapse out\"><div class=\"padded bg-black\"> <p>Add a new setting for clouds to the mix and you are going to end with a <strong>romantic sunrise! The clouds are now properly affected by the light conditions and their shape should feel more natural<\/strong>. We had to add several more steps for both day light settings and various weather conditions, the number of sets multiplied four-times.<\/p> <\/div><\/div> <div class=\"box box-black btn-block border-bottom-grey\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseSeaShader\" class=\"collapsed btn-collapse text-left\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-plus\"><\/span><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-minus\"><\/span> SEA SHADER<\/a><\/div> <div id=\"collapseSeaShader\" class=\"collapse out\"><div class=\"padded bg-black\"> <p>What's the best place to enjoy a sunset? Obviously a sea shore. We have adjusted that too, and a new water shader. <strong>This should fit well into the adjustments to the underwater light setup and even the shore itself should look better<\/strong> thanks to an extended wet surface at shorelines and enhanced water foam. These may seem like minor adjustments, but attention to details should make the game feel more authentic.<\/p> <\/div><\/div> <div class=\"box box-black btn-block border-bottom-grey\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseReflections\" class=\"collapsed btn-collapse text-left\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-plus\"><\/span><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-minus\"><\/span> REFLECTIONS<\/a><\/div> <div id=\"collapseReflections\" class=\"collapse out\"><div class=\"padded bg-black\"> <p><strong>'Screen Space Reflections' is a new technology that makes Arma 3's water more realistic<\/strong>.

The update comes with new ways to configure the visual part in game options, which means everyone can set the contrast levels according to their taste.<\/p> <p>And the good news for all community creators, there may be some minor flaws more evident on your materials, but generally speaking, there should be next to no work required on models already released. We have tried to adjust the light conditions to provide a soft transition between old and new lightning. For any tweaks that are necessary, we plan to publish a small guide before the upgrade reaches everyone in Update 1.60.<\/p> <h3>AIN'T IT PURDY?<\/h3> <p>Apparently there's a great exchange rate on pictures-to-words; so here's some commission-free comparison snaps of the previous and current state:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_2.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_3.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_3.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_4.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_4.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_5.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_5.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_6.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_6.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_7.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_7.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_8.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_8.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_9.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_9.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_10.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_10.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_11.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_11.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_12.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_12.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/operp_visual_13.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/operp_visual_13.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>After a year-long development, our Visual Upgrade is finally ready for its first unveiling; now, we're moving into a phase of tweaking and optimising.

It's one of those top tier requested things, both in our team and by players. We're talking about the ability to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jaycroweuk\/status\/715898385526611968\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>switch weapons on-the-move<\/strong><\/a> of course! The reason we were reluctant to mention it previously is that we wanted to be confident about delivering it for Arma 3. This feature is really pushing the limits of the Real Virtuality engine, and it probably pushes beyond them in some respects. Even though mods have previously accomplished this functionality to some degree, we wanted to only add it as a native solution that works under all conditions. It's possible there will be some unsolvable visual glitches, but we feel the enhanced control over your avatar is worth it. We're proud of the devs involved in making this happen for everyone who's been waiting for it for a long time. Now that the first version has hit <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a>, give it a go and share your <strong>feedback<\/strong> on the <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/189627-weapon-switching-on-the-move\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>forums<\/strong><\/a>. We'll meanwhile still be iterating on the animations and solving known issues. If things go well, we hope to still include this into 1.58.<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jaycroweuk\/status\/715898385526611968\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <p>But that is not the entire package for switching weapons. As part of a larger push to improve the user experience of Arma 3, Senior Designer <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Endstar\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Shobhan Roy<\/em><\/a> (R&amp;D) and Programmer <em>Marcel Marciš<\/em> have focused on bringing more control to players. <strong>Quick weapon switching<\/strong> technology has previously added new infantry and vehicle actions, allowing players to bind their weapons to any key they desire.<\/p> <p>One thing we wanted to do was put weapon switching on industry standard number keys, where they are easily reachable and recognizable. However, this conflicted with our originally hard-coded Command Menu interaction; so in order to resolve this, we extended our Command Menu functionality to let players choose when the menu opens and what keys activate it. The result? It is now possible to use weapon switching and the Command Menu on the number keys simultaneously, based on whether the menu is activated. This improved behavior can be experienced with our new <strong><em>Arma 3 Apex<\/em> controls preset<\/strong>. This new preset is slated to eventually become our default control scheme for the upcoming Apex expansion, and will take advantage of the various usability improvements. Existing presets will also stay available, probably under a <em>Arma 3 Legacy<\/em> title. Expect more additions as we progress on the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/RoadToApex\" target=\"_blank\"><em>#RoadToApex<\/em><\/a>, and we look forward to your feedback!<\/p> <p>Another useful improvement is live on Dev-Branch as well: an overhauled <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jaycroweuk\/status\/716277562062802944\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>suppression command<\/strong><\/a> via Lead Programmer <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/user\/766285-dr-hladik\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Vojtěch Hladík<\/em><\/a>. You can now actually order subordinates to lay down fire on a specific target or position (<em>3<\/em> &gt; <em>9<\/em> by default). And since <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00040\">version 1.42<\/a>, suppression has a real effect on AI, so it can be employed as a viable tactic (see <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00097\">this report<\/a>). Simply put, they will try to engage for about 15 seconds, ammunition allowing. Other commands, such as regrouping, will make them stop. This is supported by two script commands: <em>commandSuppressiveFire<\/em> and <em>doSuppressiveFire<\/em>. Since we do still need a little more time to flesh out some of the details, this work is not going to be included in 1.58 yet.

Our tech partners at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vpltd.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Virtual Programming<\/em><\/a> will then proceed to work on the next update, but we cannot yet say when it will be ready. As we communicated when we first opened the public beta for these ports, the timing of port updates cannot be guaranteed. In this case for example, our QA teams needed to prioritize 1.56 testing of the primary Windows version, causing extra delays for the ports. We do however see good support on the port platforms, so we've decided to continue updating them this year. We can also say that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.battleye.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>BattlEye<\/em><\/a> anti-cheat support should finally arrive to a future update of the ports.<\/p> <h3>INTELLIGENCE<\/h3> <p>For the most part we expect <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/top-10-arma-3-eden-update-eden-3d-editor\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Eden Editor<\/strong><\/a> to intuitively expose its functionality to scenario designers while they use it. You may however wish to broaden your knowledge of its features and workflows via the in-editor tutorials. There is a collection of topics, such as entity editing, scenario attributes, and an introduction to veteran users of the legacy 2D Editor. Relevant information is accompanied by interface highlights to show you where to go. You can access the tutorials via the <em>\"Help\"<\/em> menu bar option, and then selecting <em>\"Tutorials...\"<\/em>. Or press the special tutorials button in the top-right corner of the interface (under the eXit-button, marked by <em>!<\/em> if new lessons are available).

These allow for the possibility to dynamically <strong>override<\/strong> certain <strong>character attributes<\/strong> that are normally only defined in addon configuration files. There are two groups of attributes, namely specialty toggles and coefficients. The former are: <em>medic<\/em>, <em>engineer<\/em>, <em>pyrotechnic<\/em> and <em>uavhacker<\/em>, which are true or false. The latter are: <em>camouflageCoef<\/em>, <em>audibleCoef<\/em>, <em>fatigueCoef<\/em>, which are multiplied by the value provided.

Note that the batch scripts will remain in the tools until <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Work_Drive\" target=\"_blank\">Work Drive<\/a> is fully able to replace them.

Programming Lead <em>Ondřej Martinák<\/em> shines a light on this tweak: <em>\"Stencil shadows are still present in the game for certain objects (characters and vehicles). The reason is that they look better in some circumstances such as first-person view. We have removed the option to force stencil shadows for all objects as it didn't help performance nor quality (which it did in the past). This removal also allows us to automatically generate shadow LODs (using shadow maps) for objects.

If you'd like to participate, the Steam branch access code is: <em>Arma3Update156RC<\/em>.

Please visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/rc-branch\">Dev Hub overview page<\/a> with details and some cautions. One particular warning this time around is one-way <strong>compatibility of campaign save games<\/strong>. You will not be able to load 1.56 saves in the older 1.54 version due to fixes to inventory serialization. Campaign saves do carry over from 1.54 to the newer 1.56 (overall progress, not mid-scenario). Please keep this in mind and consider backing up your saves before switching branches. Alternatively you could use a new user profile to carry out RC tests.

First of all, there are undefined circumstances under which uniforms disappear in multiplayer. So far a specific and clean repro method is missing and that makes it harder to track the source problem. If you have an isolated repro, please do share it in the <a href=\"http:\/\/feedback.arma3.com\/view.php?id=26868\" target=\"_blank\">relevant ticket<\/a>. This appears to mostly happen in modes which use a lot of inventory scripting. One angle of attack for us is to work on low-level multiplayer inventory optimizations. These should result in a set of script commands that can fetch and apply load-outs in a much more network-friendly manner, and therefore help to avoid many kinds of inventory glitches. Parts of this code are already in use in Eden Editor's <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arsenal\" target=\"_blank\">Arsenal<\/a> integration, but it's not quite ready yet for more widespread usage. We'll be trialing this ourselves in the <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Revive\" target=\"_blank\">Revive<\/a> system.<\/p> <p>The Altis Life server crashes are even harder to solve. It's not possible for us to host this kind of server in the full debugging environment. The required mods are too complex and unfortunately suffer from data errors in many places, resulting in vast amounts of log warnings that complicate finding any pertinent information. Note that these log errors don't even necessarily show during normal gameplay, but they spam the debuggers. We're also not ruling out there is indeed an issue in the engine that might be causing these crashes, but all we've been able to do is add more and more diagnostics to the special profiling builds, and ask administrators to test these. One such build was <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/160288-arma-3-stable-server-154-performance-binary-feedback\/page-58?p=2974542#entry2974542\" target=\"_blank\">published today<\/a>, so we've not given up.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, Lead Programmer <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/user\/766285-dr-hladik\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Vojtěch Hladík<\/em><\/a> has begun work on a suite of script commands that allow the creation of <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/187670-new-command-createobject-for-decorative-objects\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>simple objects<\/strong><\/a> (decorative). This type of object is not simulated like a full object (or vehicle) and therefore costs fewer computing resources. They also do not need to be synchronized over the network as frequently. That does mean they miss a lot of functionality, like interaction and destruction. The main goal for these simple objects is to build cool object compositions in critical scenario \/ mode areas. It's also being considered how to integrate creation of these objects into Eden Editor post-release.<\/p> <h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3> <p>Another small <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/692706085040451584\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>anti-cheat update<\/strong><\/a> was deployed to main branch via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.battleye.com\/support\/faq\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>BattlEye<\/em><\/a> last week.<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/692706085040451584\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <p>We're closing this week's report with a <strong>follow-up<\/strong> to the <strong>new animations<\/strong> mentioned <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00139\">two week ago<\/a>.

It is shaping up to be an <strong>awesome free update<\/strong> to Arma 3, made possible by your support for the game. We have created our data snapshot and applied the usual development locks, so that we can begin to focus on testing and tweaking the update as a whole. This also means that we'll open the Steam <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/rc-branch\">Release Candidate<\/a> testing branch this or next week.<\/p> <p>We'll do our best to stress test the update ourselves and to ensure that no new issues are introduced.

Please focus on truly new issues and report them to <a href=\"http:\/\/feedback.arma3.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedback Tracker<\/a> with a clear indication that they were tested in the RC build. If an issue looks like it may be in custom content, kindly forward the details to the authors of that content as well. There are a number of complex platform changes that may affect compatibility even though we've striven to guard back-compat throughout. The powerful new Eden Editor affects code in the engine that is shared by both editors, the low-level audio engine was overhauled, many scripted functions were optimized and replaced by script command calls, etc. All of these will bring the platform forward in huge ways, but there is an element of risk. Together we can minimize problems, and should they occur, we'll work hard to solve them as quickly as possible.

Audio Lead <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/user\/800676-doosh\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Jan Dušek<\/em><\/a> has more:<\/p> <p><em>\"As part of our effort to refactor the audio engine and our plan to unify sound configuration, we are introducing a new sound object architecture. This new configuration replaces the old inconsistent approach, which was the result of many years of adding specific features (like sample arrays) to specific sound categories. Now, you will be able to use all low-level sound features everywhere the new configuration is applied. Currently, this new system is only used for shooting and explosions but, in future, it will cover most significant sound categories.<\/em><\/p> <p><em>So, on <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/forum\/178-arma-3-development-branch\/\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a> you can already hear two of the most significant features: 'distant samples' and the 'multi-channel panner' (a smoother transition between ambient and positional sound, which is used mainly for reflection tails). The actual state is a work in progress, and we're still processing feedback and resolving issues \/ making optimizations. Apart from this, it's worth mentioning that there is also a new class CfgSoundGlobals, which contains default \/ global sound settings. More detailed information is coming soon!\"<\/em><\/p> <p>In the past, we've hinted at an overhaul of our approach to <strong>weapon switching<\/strong>, which we'd targeted for Eden Update. To make good on that, version 1.56 will introduce <strong>new control options<\/strong> to quickly switch weapon types in vehicles, like it is for infantry. For now, you will need to bind these manually and experiment with convenient buttons, but later we plan on integrating these actions into our presets, once potential conflicts have been resolved.<\/p> <p>If you'd like to play around with this on <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a>, go to the <em>Configure<\/em> &gt; <em>Controls<\/em> &gt; <em>Weapons<\/em> tab and map the switching controls you want. As a character, you can switch to your primary weapon, secondary weapon or sidearm via dedicated controls. Pressing the same control again will start cycling firing modes for that weapon, if more are available. In vehicles, we have divided the weapons over four abstract groups. Going from group 1 to 4, these typically are: cannons or machine guns, machine guns or rockets, guided missiles, bombs or laser designators - dependent on the vehicle (there is config control over this categorization). We look forward to the feedback on this new technology, and can't wait to roll it out fully on the road to Apex.<\/p> <h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3> <p>Programmer <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/klamacz\/status\/690559681912279040\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Krzysztof Bielawski<\/em><\/a> has made several scenario designers unreasonably happy with increased <strong>control over AI entities<\/strong>.

It's possible you'll see them appear on <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\">Dev-Branch<\/a> ahead of Apex itself, but the components are mostly dependent on each other, so we need to coordinate this carefully. All of these changes are unrelated to our investigation into DirectX 12 by the way. This has not yet yielded useful results, so we don't have any concrete news on that front.<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/maruksp\/status\/677891075487453184\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3> <p>Arma 3 launched with a very distinctive <strong>animation for walking and for moving in tactical pace with your weapon lowered<\/strong>.

Project Lead <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lathspel\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Petr Kolář<\/em><\/a> kicks off with a description of several technical improvements:<\/p> <p><em>\"There are plenty of new features heading onto <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a> just as you read these lines. Our programmers have decided to make the lives of content creators easier, mainly for those creating new models. They will be able to use a technology that <strong>generates shadows<\/strong> of objects <strong>on-the-fly<\/strong> based on the shape of a resolution LOD. Two occlusion-related features are joining the party too, one of them being a new ambient occlusion technology <strong>HBAO+<\/strong> (available in the Video Options &gt; AA &amp; PP). The other allows creators to place shapes and faces that prevent drawing of anything behind the so-called <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Geometric_Occluders\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Geometric Occluders<\/strong><\/a> (developed for our company's new Enfusion engine, parts of which can still benefit Arma 3). This has not been fully implemented in our data yet, but it should provide a gain of performance mainly in urban areas. Existing content will continue to work, but using the new tech will require models to be updated to benefit from it.<\/em><\/p> <p><em>All these new features still need to be properly documented, and that brings us to the most important change: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lathspel\/status\/686880008904798208\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>new parallax technology<\/strong><\/a> for ground surfaces. It's been already <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Parallax_Map\" target=\"_blank\">documented<\/a> on the Community Wiki, because it changes the way parallax behaves even for custom-made terrains! The effect will likely work, but its depth may be more than you'd like. See the documentation for a simple guide on how to correct this. The major benefit of this change is to remove the ugly artifacts when moving close to the ground. We hope you are going to like these post-holiday gifts and we're looking for your feedback on them.\"<\/em><\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lathspel\/status\/686880008904798208\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <p>Next up is a change that is rather in your face. We're going to <strong>change the fonts<\/strong> for the game, <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Launcher\" target=\"_blank\">Launcher<\/a> and later also other places such as this very website. The goal is to make text look crisper and achieve greater legibility. As we're sure you know, some characters are currently hard to distinguish from each other for example. Besides the look and feel of the font, we've also improved memory consumption by utilizing texture sharing. This will mostly help with various Asian languages that have massive character sets. In turn, this has led to significant improvements to the <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/FontToTga\" target=\"_blank\">FontToTGA<\/a> tool.<\/p> <h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3> <p>Another significant new technology is not something you'll actually see or notice while playing. BI's Chief Technology Officer <em>Petr Benýšek<\/em> introduces us to more advanced <strong>analytics<\/strong> in Arma 3 (and our other games):<\/p> <p><em>\"Since the release of Arma 3, we've had a general overview of how the game is being played, what game mod(e)s are most popular and what people like or dislike. But this information was coming mostly from the vocal part of our community. The feedback on the forums and other channels is great and will still be used as until now. Nevertheless, it doesn't give us completely objective and unbiased information and it doesn't include feedback from a considerable part of our players. A popular and nowadays broadly used way of gathering data about player behavior is through game analytics. This allows us to know better our players (without actually disturbing them while playing), and thanks to that, to build a better gaming experience.<\/em><\/p> <p><em>Along with the update 1.56, we are introducing game analytics into Arma 3. Its purpose is to collect basic information about the game, such as game settings, enabled mods, favorite scenarios and weapons, player deaths or actual performance, and report them to our analytics server. If you don't want to be part of that, you will have an option to disable it in the Launcher options. Fear not however, the amount of data is small and should not affect your gameplay experience in any way. It's also all anonymous and the data will be used solely for understanding how Arma 3 is being played. The more data we will gather, the more precisely we will know what you like in the game and how you play it - which in turn will guide us to set our priorities and make the game better for you.\"<\/em><\/p> <p>We'd like to add that we see this as an additional tool for our decision-making process, but we do not intent in any way to let analytics data be our sole or primary input. We'll continue to engage with players via all channels and your feedback will remain a hugely important part of our development methods. Analytics will help us with decisions such as the removal of redundant video options, proving that such options are indeed no longer in use. Or we can use them to learn what parameters to expose more clearly in our Launcher. They may also be used to measure how two approaches to a solution on <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a> work in the actual game for example.<\/p> <p>It's been a long time coming, but we've finally found a moment to restore <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ondrejkuzel\/status\/685062681125097473\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>amphibious simulation<\/strong><\/a> to <strong>tracked vehicles<\/strong> (for the <em>tankx<\/em> PhysX-based simulation class if you'd like to get technical). Programmer <em>Tomáš Nezval<\/em> has now added the engine-side implementation, but it will require updated vehicle configurations to make use of this. Our vanilla tracked vehicles have not needed an amphibious capability thus far, but there are several big mods who will benefit from this functionality being back in the game.<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ondrejkuzel\/status\/685062681125097473\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <p>Another cool addition for vehicles is the ability to set up <strong>wrecks<\/strong> to use the <strong>dynamically textured livery<\/strong> of the vehicle. Until now, there would be a generic wreck for every variant of a vehicle.

To facilitate a more useful organisation in the many assets for <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-eden-editor-beta\">Eden Editor<\/a>, new properties and categories will be created and assets are to be moved between them. This may also affect the current 2D editor in a few cases, since these changes happen on an object-level (don't worry - there will not be drastic class name alterations for example - we'll document the configuration options soon). In addition, more objects will become available (e.g. military cargo buildings, other structures and ruins) to place in your scenarios and to create nice compositions.<\/p> <h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3> <p>A second <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00051\"><strong>1.54 hotfix<\/strong><\/a> was released just before the winter break. It addressed various (mod) compatibility issues, fixed game instabilities and made small tweaks to weapon sway. There are however still several things we're working on solving as soon as possible:<\/p> <ul> <li>We've temporarily disabled white-listing functionality in the <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki?title=Arma_3_Remote_Execution\" target=\"_blank\">remote execution<\/a> technology. Once the tech was broadly enabled for standard scripted functions like <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/BIS_fnc_MP\" target=\"_blank\">BIS_fnc_MP<\/a>, a lot of back-compat issues arose in custom scenarios. Or rather: the tech worked, but it asked for too many manual changes from server admins \/ scenario designers to set up their white-listing properly. Not doing so would cause parts of the tech to be disabled, and the scenarios to be crippled. It's important to note that you can still disable the technology, but you cannot allow it selectively at the moment. Operation mode 1 is currently doing the same as 2, whereas 0 still disables it.

Here we'd like to briefly discuss the higher level goals of the End Game Tournament, provide a short summary of how it progressed, and share some of the key lessons learned.<\/p> <p>Before we dig in, for those who missed it, the Arma 3 End Game Tournament was a head to head single elimination tournament - featuring 8 teams made up by community groups, developers, and other special guests. The tournament unfolded over the month of November, leading up to the Finals on Saturday December 5th. All matches were live streamed on the official <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/arma3official\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 Twitch channel<\/a>.<\/p> <p>To retro-actively catch the action yourself, head on over to the official Arma 3 Twitch channel to re-watch any of the previous live streamed match ups in their entirety <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/arma3official\/profile\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>. Or check out the full and some edited down shorter highlight versions on MicOne's&nbsp;YouTube Channel <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/MicOneJuliet\/videos\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <h3>The Goal<\/h3> <p>First and foremost, the tournament's main goal was to organize <strong>a fun and entertaining live stream event<\/strong>. Of course we also seized it as an opportunity to promote the revamped End Game multiplayer mode, featured in the recently released <a href=\"http:\/\/arma3.com\/nexus\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 Nexus update<\/a>. On top of that, it gave us a direct purpose to reach out and connect with Arma community members and groups, plus establish the ground work for potential similar activities in the future.<\/p> <p>With those goals in mind, from the early planning and discussions of the tournament, we already knew we would be facing some unique challenges. To name three specifically:<\/p> <ul> <li>First, End Game mode was not specifically designed to be used in a tournament setting. Plus, since we're a relatively small team and thus always need to consider our priorities, we were careful not to take away any resources from the core Arma 3 dev team.<\/li> <li>Second, we wanted to finish the tournament early December, as we wanted to stay ahead of the busy holiday season for a number of reasons. However, the Nexus update was still in development, and changes were still being made to get it ready for release.<\/li> <li>Third, we knew we had to host this tournament over the Internet, with players connecting from all over the world (mostly Europe). This would bring along some uncontrollable risks, such as connection issues (in contrast to hosting a tournament in a more controlled LAN environment).<\/li> <\/ul> <p>Despite these challenges we decided to press on with the plans, as we felt these limitations would be acceptable given the modest intentions for this tournament. After all, this event would be primarily played for fun.<\/p> <p>With that in mind, after seeing some of the highly entertaining shoutcasting events&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/bravoco.us\/bc\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bravo Company<\/a>'s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MicOneJuliet\" target=\"_blank\">MicOne<\/a>&nbsp;was producing (called&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eam1Y0xRcOQ\" target=\"_blank\">Friday Night Fights<\/a>), we knew we had to contact him to see if he might be interested in doing the commentary for the End Game Tournament. We were ecstatic to hear back from him and that he wanted to get involved. Even better, he also brought in the leader of Bravo Company,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/StardogBC\" target=\"_blank\">Stardog<\/a>, as the co-commentator.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/EGTallTeamsW.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/EGTallTeamsW.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>Next, we reached out to some of the established Arma community groups in the European general timezone, to see who might be interested and available. One thing we can say about the Arma community is that it is filled with positive, receptive and enthusiastic people who are ready to get involved. Many thanks go out to all the teams who participated:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/gaming.realitygamer.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">RG Task Force<\/a>&nbsp;(UK),&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/ofcrav2.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">OFCRA<\/a>&nbsp;(FR),&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.armalusa.pt\/\" target=\"_blank\">Armalusa<\/a>&nbsp;(PT),&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bdrclan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">BDR Clan<\/a>&nbsp;(IT),&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.liberatedgaming.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Liberated Gaming<\/a>&nbsp;(UK) and&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.tangodown.nl\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tangodown<\/a>&nbsp;(NL). The slots for teams were filled very quickly, and we still had a huge list of potential teams that we could have contacted.<\/p> <p>Of course, with this being our first tournament live stream event, we wanted to add something unique to make it special. Thus, the Bohemia Dev squad came together, a team consisting of Bohemia Interactive developers: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ondrejkuzel\" target=\"_blank\">oukej<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/burkhar\" target=\"_blank\">Burkhar<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/klamacz\" target=\"_blank\">klamacz<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VojtechKovaric\" target=\"_blank\">Iceman<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ZipperFive\" target=\"_blank\">Zipper5<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/user\/751258-smookie\/\" target=\"_blank\">smookie<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Adam_BIS\" target=\"_blank\">Adam<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/falagor\" target=\"_blank\">falagor<\/a> and team leader <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Endstar\" target=\"_blank\">Endstar<\/a>. And, for the final team, a new team made up of individuals, Arma personalities and prominent live streamers, the 'Arma 3 Ambassadors':&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/1PARA_Melle\" target=\"_blank\">-1PARA-Melle<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BattleRoyaleMod\" target=\"_blank\">PLAYERUNKNOWN<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/gaming.youtube.com\/Jester814\" target=\"_blank\">Jester814<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/acesfury\" target=\"_blank\">Acesfury<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/aimpr\/\" target=\"_blank\">aimPR<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/moondye7\" target=\"_blank\">Moondye7<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/execcs\" target=\"_blank\">Exec<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/sbiggstv\" target=\"_blank\">SbiggsTV<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/aethos19d\" target=\"_blank\">Aethos19D<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/break71\" target=\"_blank\">BreaK71<\/a>.<\/p> <h3>The Highlights<\/h3> <p>As previously mentioned, it's worth watching the replays <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/arma3official\/profile\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/MicOneJuliet\/videos\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>. Words don't really do justice to the full experience you get from watching it and listening to the commentary from MicOne and Stardog. Overall, we can honestly say each of the match ups were action packed filled with unique and epic moments. From the tie breaker rules confusion on the first day of the event, which lead to a show of true sportsmanship by Tangodown who agreed to a sudden death rematch with the Arma 3 Ambassadors, to the interesting evolution of strategies teams were using, and an epic final showdown between the Arma 3 Ambassadors and RG Task Force, in which the Arma 3 Ambassadors secured victory in a close 3-2 match.<\/p> <div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/668138176326815744\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div> <h3>The Takeaways<\/h3> <p>Even though we were aware of certain limitations going into this tournament, we still learned a great deal more. While it's probably not so interesting to go into each little practical detail, here are some of the key takeaways:<\/p> <p><strong>End Game &amp; Spectator Cam:<\/strong> Using End Game and the Spectator Cam in the tournament setting helped us discover some things that could be improved. It exposed some issues that the development team were immediately able to resolve, while others are still being worked on.<\/p> <p><strong>Defining the Rules:<\/strong> For any type of tournament, even if it is just for the fun and entertainment for viewers, we learned that it's essential to have all the rules spelled out clearly, including the potential tie breaker scenarios (as we found out 'the hard way'.<\/p> <p><strong>Live stream presentation:<\/strong> Unfortunately, we cannot yet justify a fully equipped studio setup for our live streams, and thus are somewhat limited, but we worked hard together with MicOne and StarDog on a professional presentation of our live streams. It's definitely not to be underestimated; the details and the complexity of a tournament live stream required multiple solutions for back up plans and testing fail overs. Information in a live tournament event changes dynamically on the fly, so its important to have a plan for transitions, score updates, potential downtime and more. It's also important to have a run time schedule that includes a minute-by-minute break down that all participants and coordinators can use as a guide to queue from.<\/p> <p><strong>3rd person view:<\/strong> It was decided very early on that 3rd person view would be allowed, as we wanted to showcase 'vanilla' Arma 3, plus we had participants coming from a wide range of different play styles. However, as many people responded, we realized that providing a competitive framework is critical for a tournament, even when its primary purpose is to provide entertaining streams to watch. Thus, potential tournaments and competitive events we'd organize in the future will most likely restrict participants to the first person perspective. That said, we should probably also point out that, even though the spectator camera showed a 1st person perspective or 3rd person chase view, it did not mean the player was using it. In other words, watching the match from the spectator perspective does not show which view the participant is using (from what we know most participants in the tournament were actually only using 1st person perspective).<\/p> <p><strong>Interest from the community:<\/strong> The tournament helped bring some more exposure to End Game, but most importantly, it showed that there is interest within the community for events such as these, albeit with different types of scenarios. It was a pleasure to see people getting involved and share their excitement, and to us, it definitely felt as if the tournament brought people closer to each other.<\/p> <p><strong>Connecting players:<\/strong> We had Bohemia Interactive developers as a team, Arma 3 Ambassadors as a team, and established squads all participating. This unique combination of players and teams brought people from different areas together. It was interesting to see the different play&nbsp;styles and to watch these people connected. It has inspired us to keep this as a focus for future events moving forward, to keep an eye on bringing communities coming from different backgrounds together.<\/p> <h3>The Wrap Up<\/h3> <p>In closing, once again hats off and respect to the teams and players that participated. Many of whom went out of there way to offer support and suggestions to help make the tournament better. To Tangodown for their show of ultimate sportsmanship by allowing the rematch to occur. To Andrews, TAE and Reality Gaming for the enthusiasm, participation throughout the tournament and for putting up such a massive epic fight in the final event, way to go RG Task Force. And, most especially, to MicOne and Stardog for their involvement, collaboration, and truly excellent commentary for each and every match up.<\/p> <p>Congratulations once again to the Arma 3 Ambassadors!<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/tournament.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/tournament.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a><\/p> <p>We look forward with optimism to possible future events in 2016 (we're currently considering something more focused on \"milsim\", and, of course, first person only!).

Even in non-gameplay related areas, we've already made a number of smaller and bigger steps, ranging from updates of our official tools to the release of our <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Launcher\" target=\"_blank\">Launcher<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Publisher\" target=\"_blank\">Publisher<\/a>. The latest significant addition was the introduction of '<a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Launcher_-_Mod_Handling\" target=\"_blank\">mod dependencies<\/a>' via the Launcher in the <a href=\"http:\/\/arma3.com\/nexus\" target=\"_blank\">Nexus Update<\/a>. But even with all these changes, we are well aware that there are still areas which deserve our attention and we would like to soon address yet another such aspect of the game.<\/p> <p>As the name of this blog has probably told you already, our next planned step is to overhaul the server browsing experience. Besides the UI changes, we would also like to present various new or improved functionality features. The biggest themes of our ongoing work are definitely advanced filtering and extended mod support. To achieve all this, we needed to do another significant step and move the new Server Browser into the Launcher.<\/p> <h3>NEW SERVER BROWSER<\/h3> <p>The current server browser has already enjoyed some useful updates during the development of Arma 3, but the core is still the same as it was in Arma 2. We don't think it is able to fulfil modern trends and requirements any more. Unlike some other games, our intention is to still fully support custom dedicated servers and browsing of individual servers. However, we do want to make it much more convenient for a regular user to get into a good session.<\/p> <p>With all this in mind, we have recently started to analyse and prepare a complex overhaul of the whole feature and now we would like to present here our plans for the future direction of its development. The result should be a completely new Launcher-based Server Browser, which offers a whole bunch of improved and new features.<\/p> <div class=\"box box-black btn-block border-bottom-grey\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseLauncher\" class=\"collapsed btn-collapse text-left\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-plus\"><\/span><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-minus\"><\/span> LAUNCHER<\/a><\/div> <div id=\"collapseLauncher\" class=\"collapse out\"><div class=\"padded bg-black\"> <p>Direct Launcher integration allows us to use features already available in the Launcher - &nbsp;mod handling, mod dependencies, etc. - &nbsp;and invest more development time in other necessary places. To avoid a potential confusion: we do not plan to remove the ability to connect to a multiplayer session directly from the game. We are well aware that not everyone uses our Launcher and our goal is to keep the game fully playable even without it. But, similar to the mod handling, the cooperation between Launcher and game should make your life significantly easier and, with its automatic mod handling, a Launcher-bases Server Browser makes even more sense.<\/p> <\/div><\/div> <div class=\"box box-black btn-block border-bottom-grey\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseFiltering\" class=\"collapsed btn-collapse text-left\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-plus\"><\/span><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-minus\"><\/span> FILTERING<\/a><\/div> <div id=\"collapseFiltering\" class=\"collapse out\"><div class=\"padded bg-black\"> <p>Filters are one of the main features we would like to push forward. While the current implementation already offers a basic set of filters, our plan is to create a system matching current standards in games. We would like to preserve the simplicity of basic filtering features like servers with friends, recently used servers and some others. On the other hand, we feel the current filters don't offer enough options for more complex filtering and we want to offer a space and tools to find exactly the servers you are looking for. Filtering according to mods running on a server is probably one of the most anticipated features we plan to present in this area. You should be also now able to filter only servers which you are able to connect to, but possibilities are going to be much bigger.<\/p> <\/div><\/div> <div class=\"box box-black btn-block border-bottom-grey\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseModSupport\" class=\"collapsed btn-collapse text-left\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-plus\"><\/span><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-minus\"><\/span> MOD SUPPORT<\/a><\/div> <div id=\"collapseModSupport\" class=\"collapse out\"><div class=\"padded bg-black\"> <p>Thanks to Steam Workshop and Launcher, Arma 3 already made some big steps in the area of mod support. You are able to find and get a mod fast and without any additional knowledge required. But our new Server Browser should push all this even further. We would like to extend the communication between server and client far enough to be able to solve most of the mod-related issues automatically. Now you will find a server that you want to connect to and the Server Browser will do most of the necessary work for you. It checks the mods running on the server, recognizes the missing mods and offers you an automatic download of these missing mods.<\/p> <p>At this time it is necessary to mention that this functionality will be highly dependent on Steam Workshop, from which we download all missing mods. Unfortunately, this means that we are not able to support this functionality in case of mods distributed in any other way. When any such mod is required, we let you know that there is a missing mod which we are not able to get automatically for you. We plan to look into this area in the future; however, our current research indicates that we might not be able to overcome all technical obstacles and, therefore, the support of local mods in the future is still an open question. Furthermore, you will be still forced to restart the game when (un)loading any mods; this is a restriction we are not able to overcome.<\/p> <\/div><\/div> <h3>RELEASE PLAN<\/h3> <p>Together with release of this OPREP, we have released the first version of new Server Browser to <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev Branch<\/a>. This is a basic release with a view to building on a solid start. We plan to update it regularly and even add some key features that are not yet present. The mod handling is an example of a feature which will be added later, when we will be ready to share it with you. The final release is currently planed for the Eden Update, due Q1 2016.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to let us know your ideas, experiences or bugs you may experience.

Despite of many tools having been updated, the following summary covers the key elements.<\/p> <p>First up is <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Addon_Builder\" target=\"_blank\">Addon Builder<\/a>. It now has an option to <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Binarize\" target=\"_blank\">Binarize<\/a> all textures present in the source directory. And prior to this update, it was only able to use the default exclusion file present in the install directory of <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/FileBank\" target=\"_blank\">FileBank<\/a>. From now on, you can define your own from the options dialog. Along with these two new features, the dependencies (shared with <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Publisher\" target=\"_blank\">Publisher<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/A3_Launcher\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 Launcher<\/a>) have received some improvements.<\/p> <p>Another important change is the removal of the Licensed Data Packages from Steam. This was the last step of <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/184311-arma-3-samples-and-licensed-data-packages-important-update\/\" target=\"_blank\">the reorganization<\/a> of the samples. If you were using this branch, you will be automatically switched back to the main branch. Obviously, the data packages themselves are still available <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bistudio.com\/community\/licenses\/licensed-data-packages\" target=\"_blank\">via our website<\/a>.<\/p> <p>We&#39;ve also added a few new samples. Starting with programming: the SDK of <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Terrain_Processor\" target=\"_blank\">Terrain Processor<\/a> has been released and new examples of Extensions (written in C#) have been included. The latter are part of the same solution (including the C++ samples), so you will need to install both Visual C++ and Visual C#.<\/p> <p>Continuing with the samples, the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/BIS_fnc_unitHeadgear\" target=\"_blank\">Headgear Randomization<\/a> (for the record, this system was rebuilt <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00047\" target=\"_blank\">last august<\/a>) has been documented for both use cases, from an addon and from a scenario. Finally, Nexus Update features a new <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Stamina\" target=\"_blank\">stamina system<\/a> which seeks to better communicate the effects of prolonged movement and encumbrance. However, we&#39;re aware that some players may want to stick with the old approach for now. This is why we&#39;ve added a little example &#39;mod&#39; which, using the new and better moddable stamina system, simulates the previous fatigue behavior. You can also find an unofficial functional version of this mod directly on the <a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=561559542\" target=\"_blank\">Workshop<\/a>, courtesy of Senior Designer<em> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JosefZemanek1\" target=\"_blank\">Josef Zem&aacute;nek<\/a><\/em>.<\/p> <p>Last but not least, <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Game_Updater\" target=\"_blank\">Game Updater<\/a>: it now supports the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.steampowered.com\/kb_article.php?ref=1266-OAFV-8478\" target=\"_blank\">Two-Factor code Steam Guard<\/a>. When needed, a dialog asking for the code will be displayed. This took more time than expected because in its first iteration, this security mode was not supported for CLI connections. Its update process also received some visual updates; the impact of the different steps on the progress bar have been revised. The initialization and the validation steps will count for 10%, the download step counts for 80% (which reflects the current state of the download), and the final step which consists of a few adjustments for the game and the launcher is 10% of the entire process.<\/p> <p>We invite the most curious of you to have a look at the full change log.

We began with the E-bracket match between the <a href=\"http:\/\/units.arma3.com\/unit\/bohemia-dev-squad\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Bohemia Dev Squad<\/strong><\/em><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/units.arma3.com\/unit\/a3ambassadors\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Arma 3 Ambassadors<\/strong><\/em><\/a> (who were reinforced by <a href=\"http:\/\/units.arma3.com\/unit\/tangodown\"><em>Tangodown<\/em><\/a>&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/NyteMyre\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>NyteMyre<\/em><\/a>). Pre-match voting indicated even odds, but ultimately the Ambassadors were victorious in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ZipperFive\/status\/670684552097079296\" target=\"_blank\">2-0<\/a> win. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Adam_BIS\/status\/670937860921536512\" target=\"_blank\">Viewers<\/a> were treated to many interesting combat tactics by both teams, and a vehicle destruction derby was especially entertaining to see. If you do watch the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/arma3official\/v\/27879901\" target=\"_blank\">whole recording<\/a>, be sure to look out for the part where all members of the Dev Squad chase an enemy Ifrit on foot! The last round did have to be restarted because of an unfortunate glitch causing the schematics to disappear. This should since have been fixed for the finals. We obviously praise the great effort by our team&#39;s top players, but our congratulations go to the Ambassadors who managed to form a cohesive team of individual players and secure their place in the finals.<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ZipperFive\/status\/670684552097079296\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <p>For the second half of the semis, we witnessed a battle between <a href=\"http:\/\/units.arma3.com\/unit\/armalusa\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Armalusa<\/strong><\/em><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/units.arma3.com\/unit\/realitygaming\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>RG Task Force<\/strong><\/em><\/a>. The first round was hotly debated, because it resulted in a tie with an advantage for phase II winner Armalusa. This was partly possible because of the mechanic governing the availability of the schematics in phase III. We do have plans to change this in some way, such as allowing both teams to pick them up at any time or another method, but it was decided to not change the mode&#39;s rules during the tournament. For now, if you want to secure the win, you&#39;ll just have to be decisively better and RG took on that challenge in the following rounds. The second round was won by RG after a phase II blitz and clever Ifrit park at the upload location. This result allowed the final round to be one of the most entertaining of the tournament. Armalusa knew they had to win and gave it their best. There was a lot of intense on-foot combat leading up to a spectacular finale. Armalusa was very close to completing the final upload, when RG&#39;s Cpl.Tristan stole the schematics in the nick of time! RG 1, Armalusa 0.

Armalusa took the first game and OFCRA took the second game, in two quite evenly matched games. With the scores tied, anticipation grew to see who could take the win in game 3. In that game Armalusa secured the 'retrieve' task in Phase II of End Game, effectively netting them the win in the event the game would end in a draw. With this advantage under their belt, Armalusa took their time choosing to hold off on picking up the schematics till it was clear they would have a safe and secure path to their upload point. With only a few minutes remaining in the game, Armalusa picked up the schematics and started to make their way there. Being extra cautious, they kept the schematics secure and on-the-move, out of potential threat of them being taken away. The game ultimately did end in a draw, so Armalusa will be moving on the Semi-Finals.<\/em><\/p> <p><em>Between the regularly scheduled C and D match-ups, we saw the exciting sudden death rematch between <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tangodownNL\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tangodown<\/strong><\/a> and the <strong>Arma 3 Ambassadors<\/strong> team (read up on what prompted this in a <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00131\">past report<\/a>). The first game in the rematch was very close with tremendous efforts by both teams that ended in a draw. Needing a win to make it to the Semi-Finals, both teams played in a second game without a dull moment, which ended with a back-and-forth struggle to gain control of the schematics. In the end and by a narrow margin, the Arma 3 Ambassadors team pulled off the win in game 2.<\/em><\/p> <p><div class=\"video-wrapper\" id=\"g5V9VZM8RpU\"><div class=\"absolute-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g5V9VZM8RpU\" data-video=\"g5V9VZM8RpU\" data-container=\".video-wrapper#g5V9VZM8RpU\" data-removeitem=\".video-wrapper#g5V9VZM8RpU .btn\" class=\"btn btn-play\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-play\"><\/span><\/a><\/div><img src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/g5V9VZM8RpU\/maxresdefault.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/div><\/p> <p><em>The final match-up of the evening, Quarter-Finals D, commenced with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/realitygameruk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RG Task Force<\/strong><\/a> meeting <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LiberatedGaming\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Liberated Gaming<\/strong><\/a>.

Stamina recuperation and exhaustion rates have been improved, to keep the game decisive, yet fluid, while the availability of sprinting after reaching an exhausted state has been further restricted. To manage combat effectiveness when fatigued or injured, players can no longer hold their breath indefinitely, and will now need to learn and master the best times to steady their aim, to compensate for weapon sway. Hold breath timings have changed, while improvements to the system itself add new sounds and reward players for conserving oxygen. A subtle animation slowdown has been added to terrain gradients, bringing a deeper level of connection and encouraging players to make more tactical decisions about their environment. Finally, a pesky bug that allowed for players to recuperate stamina very quickly has been squashed.<\/p> <p>We're also preparing to publish a <strong>Legacy Fatigue Mod<\/strong> as example modification with sources in <a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/390500\/\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 Samples<\/a>.

There are a great variety of Arma 3 community groups; however, it’s not always easy for players to find these, or to set up a new one. With Arma 3 Units, we hope to make a modest first step towards lowering this barrier of entry. As a result, more players will be able to discover the variety of playstyles, enjoy a more meaningful gaming experience, and perhaps even establish new friendships.<\/p> <p>In essence, Arma 3 Units could be described as an online catalog of Arma 3 community groups (referred to as 'units'), and a promotional\/recruitment tool for new and existing groups\/clans. With the initial launch of the website, which is scheduled for the end of November\/start of December, we aim to deliver the core components of the service, namely the browsing of units and registration of new units. A bit further down the line, however, we intend to add more features – such as the ability to join a unit with your Bohemia Account, schedule events, and more.<\/p> <p>Beyond our near future development plans, which we'll dig into a bit more later in this OPREP, we see many more possibilities for Arma 3 Units. Our internal wishlist is already significant, plus we expect to receive many more splendid suggestions from our community. At the same time, we do also need to recognize potential limitations in time and resources, which effectively means we'll have to carefully balance the focus of our web team between the different projects within Bohemia Interactive. That said, if successful, we do consider Arma 3 Units to be a potential longer-term endeavor.<\/p> <h3>THE FOUNDATION &amp; THE FUTURE<\/h3> <p>As mentioned earlier, the initial Foundation Release of Arma 3 Units will provide the core functionality of browsing through units, and, of course, the registration of units. After the Foundation Release has been deployed, we'll be directing our attention towards on a number of features that we consider essential additions to the service. When visiting the Arma 3 Units website, you will already see some of these features hinted at in the website layout, but they will have been grayed out with a tool tip that says \"coming soon\". For now, let's discuss these 'upcoming' features in a bit more detail.<\/p> <p>Firstly, we'll be focusing on the integration of Bohemia Accounts into Arma 3 Units. This should enable players to more easily join or apply for a unit, while unit admins will be able to manage and review member applications from within the Units admin section. In addition, depending on a unit's privacy settings, using Bohemia Accounts will make it possible to automatically calculate a unit's size, and display the names of the players that are connected to the particular unit. Also, by integrating Bohemia Accounts, we're opening the door for connecting Arma 3 Units to the Arma 3 game – which in turn could enable us (eventually) to more seamlessly integrate in-game group management systems such as the infamous <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/squad.xml\" target=\"_blank\">squad.xml<\/a>.<\/p> <p>After that, our next priority will be the creation of events by units, and for unit members (and\/or non-members) to join these events. Plus, on top of that we want to provide a place where Arma 3 players, who are not necessarily part of a Unit, can quickly find other players to form a squad and head into multiplayer together right away – whether it's for a round of End Game, a co-operative scenario, a sandbox game mode, or something else. To complete the package, we intend to implement a push notifications system, which should help users to keep better track of unit announcements and events.<\/p> <h3>BETA GET READY<\/h3> <p>Before we get to that, we'll be hosting a short closed beta test, to ensure a solid Foundation Release in the comings weeks. The primary purpose of this closed beta is to identify technical errors, streamline the user experience, and tweak the website layout. To participate in the closed beta, we're inviting admins\/leaders of Arma community groups that are interested. <strong>More information on how to join, and where to report you feedback, can be found on the <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/186147-arma-3-units-feedback\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bohemia Forums<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p> <p>Arma 3 Units, what else? Besides the things we've discussed in this OPREP, we have not yet specified the long-future plans for the service. One of the things we could imagine is to directly integrate Arma Units into the Arma 3 Launcher (and perhaps even into the game itself). Then there are other, more 'wild' ideas that could expand upon the service, such as potentially facilitating the organization of tournaments between units, or enabling a unit to form alliances with other units. However, for now, our focus is to make sure the core framework is there, and once the concept has proven itself, we hope to involve all of you in the brainstorm on Arma Units' future.<\/p> <p>In closing, we hope this dev blog gives you a better understanding of our development plans and goals for Arma 3 Units. You can expect another status update from us in the next couple of months. In the meantime, please let us know your thoughts\/ideas\/suggestions\/notes.

After well over a hundred reports and therefore weeks, the time has come for me to hand the Arma 3 project to someone else. As of this week, the game will be in the capable hands of someone most of you know: former Encoding Lead, Lord of the Bounce, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lathspel\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Petr Kolář<\/strong><\/em><\/a>. He will <strong>lead<\/strong> the awesome team on the road to Apex and beyond.<\/p> <p>It has been a huge honor to re-shape the game and team as we went through Early Access graduation and over two years of post-release support so far. Considering there were times when we believed the game might never be released, it’s a great joy to see the unique Arma series in a stronger position than ever before now. Sure, not everything went smoothly and some things we wish we’d handled differently. It will make for an interesting post-mortem eventually, but Arma 3 is far from dead. I’m incredibly proud of everyone involved with the project, including the community of modders, server admins and players.<\/p> <p>This change was planned for a while, but now we’re close to the first milestone on <a href=\"http:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/arma-3-roadmap-2015-16\" target=\"_blank\">the expansion roadmap<\/a>, the time is right. I’ll continue to work on the game as Producer for some time, most likely even writing up more of these reports, as I slowly prepare for a new challenge within Bohemia Interactive. Thank you for your support and cheers to a splendid future in the Armaverse!<\/p> <p><em>-<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/YorisYan\" target=\"_blank\">Joris-Jan van ‘t Land<\/a><\/em>, Project Lead (ret.)<\/p> <h3>INTELLIGENCE<\/h3> <p>Your Saturday entertainment should be sorted for the next couple of weeks.

Those now also actually show a (generic) round being manipulated for improved immersion.<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReMuuf\/status\/658683172968906752\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3> <p>The Environment department has found a few moments to address smaller issues and glitches reported for <strong>Stratis<\/strong> and <strong>Altis<\/strong> over the past many months.

There certainly is room for discussion and tweaks. Our goal is to bring the interesting gameplay of having to consider your movement, load-out and their effects on your character's state to more Arma players (who frequently replace the vanilla system or disable it all-together now). One part of this is improved communication to the player via the optional <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReMuuf\/status\/654662671933943808\" target=\"_blank\">Stamina Bar<\/a> for example. We do not intend to make movement unrestricted, nor to have fully equipped soldiers sprinting everywhere. It's possible that even after the next weeks of iterations, you still feel the mechanic does not fit with your vision of Arma. To cater to this, we're creating a sample mod that demonstrates how to set up the game close to what it is in main branch now, but also enables you to tweak it further to your liking.<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReMuuf\/status\/654662671933943808\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <p>We've also done some <strong>small tweaks<\/strong> to character movement to make <strong>Close Quarter Combat movement<\/strong> a tiny bit smoother.

Recently, we've been working on some changes that will alter the in-game experience, and we'd like to make sure everyone understands our motivation for making these changes.<\/p> <p>We wish to tell you what we've changed in regard to hitpoints, hit reactions and stamina, and how you and your friends can use these improved game systems to gain an edge in combat situations.<\/p> <h2>OPEN LETTER<\/h2> <p>Before focusing upon changes to combat mechanics and stamina, I'd like to quickly introduce myself. So, hello everyone, I am <em>Miloslav Cinko<\/em>. I've been working at Bohemia Interactive for a few years now and, recently, I became Arma 3's Sandbox Design Lead. Previously, I worked as QA Lead for quite some time.<\/p> <p>Among other decisions, I was tasked to choose a <a href=\"http:\/\/feedback.arma3.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedback Tracker<\/a> platform. Therefore, it pleases me that (with great thanks to Web Developer <em>Jervant Malakjan<\/em> for making it possible) it works as intended, serving as a bridge between the community and the developers. Not unlike now, when we wish to present some changes to already existing systems based on some feedback from you.<\/p> <p>Why would we do this? Well, the Arma franchise is unique in the way that it supports the community for such a long time after release. Between <a href=\"http:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/marksmen\" target=\"_blank\">Marksmen DLC<\/a> and the Apex expansion itself, we have the opportunity to address issues pointed out by scenario makers, modders, players and our own developers - creating a better experience for everyone.<\/p> <h2>PERSONAL PROTECTION<\/h2> <p>We've always had some form of soldier protection in Arma, be it class based, difficulty based or item based, as we do now. Feedback provided by the community showed us the need to rebalance it. Why? In-game behavior was not what players expected.<\/p> <p>Sandbox Designer, <em><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/user\/835204-solzenicyn\/\" target=\"_blank\">Radko Voda<\/a><\/em>, went through your opinions and ideas, and devised a hitpoint-based solution, which enhances the lethality of shots to unprotected parts of the body. The general objective is to strike a balance between passive soldier protection and active marksmanship skills. That extra second you invest in the deployment of your weapon or aiming precisely might mean the difference between life and death. For your target, obviously.<\/p> <div><div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/OPREPCore_HitPoints_1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/OPREPCore_HitPoints_1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/OPREPCore_HitPoints_2.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/OPREPCore_HitPoints_2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/OPREPCore_HitPoints_3.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/OPREPCore_HitPoints_3.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <\/div><\/div> <p>Related to this, so-called 'hit reactions' by both players and AI were a bit exaggerated and, as you might have noticed, not the nicest in the world. Thanks to community veteran <em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Dslyecxi\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Gluck<\/a><\/em>'s proposal and Radko's work, we were able to take away a little of the ridiculous flinching and add a little blood and clarity. This will not only reduce unwanted animations for AI \/ players when fired upon, but also introduce a new visual feedback mechanism for players to tell whether their shooting was successful or not.<\/p> <h2>STAMINA<\/h2> <p>There were always multiple approaches we could take to represent the negative impact of prolonged loaded movement upon a soldier's effectiveness. Many opinions were shared during development and even the team was divided. Obviously, we were unsure how players would receive these new gameplay-altering mechanics but, thanks to Feedback Tracker, we found out. Feedback from scenario designers, modders and admins confirmed our suspicions that the system was not transparent enough for some (and not a small portion).<span> A dedicated group of designers from various departments, such as Research &amp; Development's <\/span><em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Endstar\" target=\"_blank\">Shobhan Roy<\/a><\/em><span> and Playable Content's <\/span><em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ZipperFive\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Ryan<\/a><\/em><span>, took on the challenge of revisiting this aspect of the game. <\/span>We've now prepared a new implementation: <em>stamina<\/em>. This system manages the exhaustion of players during missions. It replaces the current fatigue system, granting the player a little more freedom.<\/p> <p>Stamina is represented by an optional UI element, giving players feedback about how much of it is left and what is happening to their avatar in game. Players will be able to choose for themselves whether they will prioritize mobility over protection and supplies. The more a player equips, the less total sprinting time they will have, the easier it is for them to get bigger weapon sway and the harder it is for them to shoot accurately. If players equip too much, their ability to sprint is lost entirely. Recuperation time is constant for any loadout; effectively, this means that players with a heavy loadout or light scouting gear will both recuperate at the same rate, but the scout can sprint for a longer time and will be combat-ready sooner. All sub-systems are interconnected, preserving the complex decision of equipping your character in a balanced manner. The ability to move and act quickly in combat situations is one of the most crucial elements of any skirmish. You'll now be able to choose your own equilibrium between the ability to sprint for prolonged periods and a loadout that makes the most sense for your soldier.<\/p> <div><div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/OPREPCore_1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/OPREPCore_1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/OPREPCore_Stamina_Heavy.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/OPREPCore_Stamina_Heavy.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/OPREPCore_Inventory.gif\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/OPREPCore_Inventory.gif\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <\/div><\/div> <p>Overall, the system should be less limiting yet, at the same time, it should still impact gameplay greatly and provide players with more information about their status than the previous system. We also want hardcore communities to have a chance to continue playing in a manner they enjoyed. Our programmers again stepped in and created engine hooks and a series of commands allowing players to approximate the old system instead. We hope this will suit the community and everyone will be able to enjoy our game.<\/p> <h2>BIG PICTURE<\/h2> <p>If you summarize these changes, you'll see that we are taking steps to redefine combat a little bit. We're focused upon delivering solid, interconnected, infantry-centered mechanics. With the Nexus Update, players should have a more rewarding and transparent playing experience. These changes alone will give you the opportunity to spot if you a hit target better, to execute more surgical shots, and then get away in a way you weren't able to in the past, making Arma 3 a more enjoyable experience.<\/p> <p>For the last two years you've seen Arma 3 grow. We decided to use our iterative model of releases to bring changes to you one at a time, not changing the game experience too drastically so we can identify issues right away. One feature after another, we're trying to build upon the game you originally purchased, to enhance your feeling and possibilities, and to bring more authentic yet enjoyable gameplay.<\/p> <div><div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/OPREPCore_Deployment.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/OPREPCore_Deployment.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/OPREPCore_FFV.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/OPREPCore_FFV.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/OPREPCore_Stamina.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/OPREPCore_Stamina.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/a> <\/div><\/div> <p>Arma 3 was different when we released it originally.

The Y-key is used for this by default. It will sound a subtle audio cue for Zeus and highlight your name. Pinging is useful to alert Zeus to problems with the scenario, or for opportunities the GM may wish to do something with. Basically, use pinging when something is or isn't happening, but don't overdo it. Pings are only sent once per second, and Zeus may <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KarelMoricky\/status\/444519339782180864\" target=\"_blank\">not take kindly to spam<\/a>. A bit of divine trivia: when you ping, you hear a slightly different tone for the audio cue each time. Zeus hears a different tone per specific player (with some limitations), so He or She may actually recognize players by their sound alone.

He acts as the Game Master in a custom Invade &amp; Annex scenario that is already running. There are three distinct phases (see the time codes in the video description).

What follows are two stages of the actual real-time scenario as the players assault the enemy bases. It's interesting to see and hear Leutin theorize what the theoretical enemy commanders might see and how they should react with fire missions and reinforcements. He makes a point of not directly killing players, instead scaring and guiding them with indirect fire and by role-playing NPCs. Who are your favorite curators?

All of this was of course documented and the photographs sent to Prague QA for them to see what a great a time Shepard was having. While they were not very happy and talked about kidnapping and other major felonies, Shepard had the time of his life. However, everything that is good must come to an end. After a month of a splendid internship, Commander Shepard returned to his home base among his QA colleagues and is enjoying their company instead.

This said, mod authors might be interested in updating the Required Items for their Workshop items. You can do this directly from the Workshop page. Since there are a lot of large mods, another nice feature is the ability to change the folder where the downloaded mods are stored (the folder can be changed in Options &gt; tab Mod Options &gt; section Mods Storage).\"<\/em> Your discussion of these changes is very welcome in <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/180024-official-arma-3-launcher-dev-branch\/\" target=\"_blank\">this forums thread<\/a>.<\/p> <p>For weeks now, Senior Designer <em>Jiří Wainar<\/em> has been eagerly waiting to publish his <strong>optimizations<\/strong> of various <strong>scripted multiplayer systems<\/strong>. We were quite careful to roll them out, first awaiting the engine-supported remote execution to be solid. Now the time is ripe and his changes have reached Dev-Branch. Specifically this means the frameworks for <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Task_Framework\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tasks<\/strong><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki?title=Arma_3_Remote_Execution\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Remote Execution<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Task_Enhancements\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Shared Objectives<\/strong><\/a> should now function in a much leaner way. In our measurements this has led to a drastic reduction of the traffic generated by these systems, ranging from 30% to even as low as 3% of the original traffic. If your (multiplayer) scenarios already use (parts of) these underlying frameworks, you should see improvements to network performance. We'd recommend studying the linked documentation to consider whether your creations can benefit from similar optimizations. We do have plans for tweaking similar systems in this way, and Jiří hopes to share his observations as general scripting guidelines over time.<\/p> <p>There also is less optimistic news to share. Making improvements to the <strong>mid-range terrain textures<\/strong> has been a <a href=\"http:\/\/feedback.arma3.com\/view.php?id=4635\" target=\"_blank\">hot topic<\/a> for a long time. We have investigated various solutions and looked at the problem it with our programmers and environment team. Our conclusion is that it's unfortunately not realistic to expect big improvements for Arma 3. Existing community solutions can work great under certain circumstances, but in our opinion based on tests, make things worse in others. We thank you for thinking with us and for proposing some pretty advanced workarounds! The basic and short explanation from Arma 3's engine's point of view is that we're limited by our terrain shader and hard limits of the amount of textures we can store in materials. The overhaul required is too complex at this stage. If we do find a way forward, we'll re-open this decision, but it's not likely during Arma 3's life time.<\/p> <h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3> <p>For the latest on <strong>Eden Editor<\/strong>, we defer to the in-game Updates Log.

There will be a transition phase between the release in early 2016 and the main Expansion, during which both will be available. Some people were worried they would lose 2D editing, but you can of course switch to 2D mode using M by default (we also want to make it possible to set this as default view).

It has been a powerful tool for designing scenarios, from simple military operations to story-driven blockbusters. Tens of thousands of user-made scenarios were released over the years, played by hundreds of thousands of players. And even more probably went unpublished, created by people out of curiosity, or just for fun and to play around in the sandbox.<\/p> <p>A lot has changed since the 2D editor first appeared.

What happens in Beta stays in Beta.<\/p> <p>What is the advantage of this approach? We're flexible. If you have an idea for an improvement, let us know! The big green&nbsp;<strong>Feedback<\/strong>&nbsp;button on the toolbar will lead you straight to the&nbsp;<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http:\/\/feedback.arma3.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedback Tracker<\/a>&nbsp;where you can report an issue or post a suggestion. And the&nbsp;<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/forum\/199-arma-3-eden-editor\/\" target=\"_blank\">official forums<\/a>&nbsp;are a great place to discuss changes and ideas. This is&nbsp;<em>your<\/em>&nbsp;editor, help us build it!<\/p> <h2>What's New<\/h2> <p>Let us take a look at some of the most important new features, as compared to the 2D editor:<\/p> <ul> <li>You can now edit your scenario in a 3D scene (shock and awe)!<\/li> <li>Undo \/ Redo functionality<\/li> <li>An Asset Browser with a tree structure and ability to search<\/li> <li>An Entity List, giving you the option to check everything in your scenario<\/li> <li>Vehicle crews can be edited individually<\/li> <\/ul> <p>And much more, take a look yourself. If you've worked with the 2D editor before, we recommend to check the in-editor&nbsp;<strong>\"Switching from the Old 2D Editor\"<\/strong>&nbsp;tutorial.<\/p> <h2>Roadmap<\/h2> <p>The Public Beta is out, but that's just the beginning. We're planning to release periodic updates, sometimes on a daily basis, sometimes with longer intervals. We'll be announcing all changes in the in-game&nbsp;<strong>Updates Log<\/strong>&nbsp;to help you stay in touch. This will continue for several months, and then, at the beginning of 2016, we're planning to publish the Eden Editor to the default main branch. For free. For everyone.<\/p> <p>But, until that happens, there's a lot of work ahead of us. Here are the most important planned features:<\/p> <ul> <li>Entity List Layers - with an ability to hide or disable all entities inside a layer<\/li> <li>Rotation and Area Scaling widgets - so you can finally turn that car on its side<\/li> <li>Object Compositions - with an ability to share; a lot of potential there<\/li> <li>Editing History - a logical improvement to the already existing undo \/ redo buttons<\/li> <li>And finally, we're looking into a better implementation of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Description.ext\" target=\"_blank\">description.ext<\/a>&nbsp;straight into the editor. Yes, we hate setting up respawns in an external file too.<\/li> <\/ul> <h2>Modding<\/h2> <p>No, not modding using the editor, but modding the editor itself. Thanks to the full script support, almost everything is customizable now. User-made plugins can access any data from the currently edited scenario (hint for scripters: it really is just a scenario, any command will work), and enhance it by providing new systems and tools. We're in the process of writing the necessary documentation, and will let you know once it's finished.<\/p> <h2>The Fate of the 2D Editor<\/h2> <p>But what about the old 2D editor, which many of us have used for more than a decade? Don't worry, we're not killing it just yet. While the Eden Editor is in Beta, the 2D editor will exist alongside it, and it will remain the only way how to design scenarios in the default branch.<\/p> <p>Even after Eden Editor is officially released next year, both editors will coexist together for some time, giving everyone enough time to switch. But once the Expansion is out, we'll aim to remove any trace of the 2D editor, and the Eden Editor will become the official tool. The king is dead, long live the king.<\/p> <p>Thanks for participating in the Beta, and we're excited to see all your splendid creations!<\/p> ","created_at":"2015-09-29 11:40:05","excerpt":"<p>Return to Eden - 3D Editor Public Beta<\/p>\u000a","id":219,"post_header_image":null,"post_thumb":null,"public_date":"2015-09-29 11:33:00","published":"1","title":"OPREP - EDEN EDITOR BETA","type":"oprep","updated_at":"2015-09-30 09:41:40","url":"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-eden-editor-beta"},{"animation_interval":200,"author":"Joris-Jan van 't Land","content":"<p>FROM: Project Lead<br \/> TO: Arma 3 Users<br \/> INFO: Dev-Branch Activity, Eden Editor Live Stream, Autumn Sale<br \/> PRECEDENCE: Flash<\/p> <h3>SITUATION<\/h3> <p>There will be lots of interesting <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/topic\/140837-development-branch-changelog\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dev-Branch activity<\/strong><\/a> over the next couple of weeks.

The other guards should not notice this. You will want to pick your position wisely and also prioritize targets such as automatic riflemen and other marksmen. Finally, it is recommended to lower your weapon (2 x LCtrl) while trekking to another objective, in order to preserve stamina.<\/p> <p><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/644132208085729280\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p> <h3>OPERATIONS<\/h3> <p>Welcome to <strong>Eden 3D Editor<\/strong>!

We are very much interested in your feedback in <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/forum\/199-arma-3-eden-editor\/\" target=\"_blank\">the forums<\/a> and on <a href=\"http:\/\/feedback.arma3.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedback Tracker<\/a> (category <em>Eden Editor<\/em>). There is plenty of time until the main release in early 2016, so we expect lots of tweaks and some major extra features. Stay tuned for an OPREP with more details very soon. Documentation will also start to grow. On the other hand we also are curious to learn what you find out intuitively and what aspects need to be made clearer. You should keep in mind that we cannot be 100% sure that scenarios you create now are forward-compatible with the main release. We will try to achieve such compatibility, but you may want to wait before you use Eden for your major projects (they will also not be playable on main branch during Beta).
